Irish Pub is an absolute gem!\n\nWe ordered the Coast Road Inn Fish \u0026 Chips, and even though I normally don’t care for fried foods, this quickly became my favorite dish, perfectly crisp, fresh, and surprisingly light. Nanny Mac’s Shepherd’s Pie was warm, cozy, and delicious, served with hearty brown bread that made the dish even better.\n\nWe also tried the Homemade Crisps, which were a nice light appetizer with tasty Marie Rose and curry sauces. For dessert, the Sticky Toffee Pudding had a wonderful bread-pudding, like texture and just the right sweetness. And you must try their famous Irish Coffee, the cream on top was whipped to absolute perfection.\n\nEverything tasted fresh, clean, and high-quality.

Well I can tell you they haven’t. Me and my female friend entered the bar late one night to get a drink and keep our night going. Upon entering the staff was extremely friendly and lively and welcoming, especially Paul and Colby. They asked us if we knew about their current promotion and how it worked so we could get a good deal. As we sat at the bar top a group of two males and two females who all looked like they were in the mid 40’s attempted to get my attention. I turned over to them and they began to ask extremely sexual and inappropriate questions about my friend and if we were in the mood to party. Instead of reacting out of anger and this situation leading to a worse one I told them off and said leave us alone. They didn’t like this and proceeded to make degrading and negative sexual comments about myself and my friend. I immediately notified our bartender who reacted promptly and notified the bar manager. The bar manager then approached the guests who of course denied everything and in a dramatic and obvious move of being caught in the act got up and left the bar. Then I noticed the bar manager get on his phone. After talking with the staff we were told these were regulars at the bar. The team did apologize for their behavior and made it clear that it is not okay for anyone to be doing this to any other patrons. We continued to enjoy our drinks and shortly after the owner showed up welcoming back in the regulars who had just gotten kicked out. He spent about 20min speaking with them and laughing. Not once did he come over to me and my friend to apologize to us or explain why he felt it to be okay to allow such guests back in while we were still here. If this is the type of regulars this owner allows then it speaks volumes for the lack of consideration and care he has of any other business. Once again the staff did a great job checking in on us and in the end taking care of the bill as a sign of good will; which they did not have to do at all."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",null,

When I asked for clarification she said “well, we can take walk ins too” I found her comments unnecessary and her tone off putting. I hope she doesn’t treat all the guests like that.\n\nI had the bangers and mash, so delicious!! Great snap of the pork bangers skins, yummy gravy with mushrooms and creamy potatoes. My mom had the Irish cheesestake, she said it was pretty good but wasn’t a fan of the beer cheese. I also enjoyed an Irish margarita that was refreshing with Jameson orange. We shared the bread pudding. Oh my goodness it was so decadent. Just the right amount of sweetness, creamy texture, a little crunch on the top of caramelized sugar, and came out piping hot, so be patient and let it cool down…unlike us. Haha.

The fish was absolutely perfect—crispy on the outside, flaky and flavorful on the inside. It honestly might be the best fish and chips I’ve had in years.\n\nWhat really stood out was the attention to tradition. In true Irish fashion, they had malt vinegar on the table—but they also served it with a fresh lemon wedge. I ended up using both, and the combination was incredible. It added just the right balance of tang and brightness to the already delicious fish.\n\nOur waitress (I regret not getting her name) was one of the friendliest people I’ve encountered on this whole trip. She made us feel completely at home, like we’d known her for years. Places like this thrive because of people like her.

We’ve tried Cheeseburger Pizza at other places in the past but this beats those out hands down. The Ranch Dressing and Dill Pickles combine for an excellent flavor profile.\nBe adventurous.

There was only three or four other people in there, It was evening time, but clearly I waited a long time to even be acknowledged. It was well over thirty minutes before she even acknowledged my presence.And once she did, she gave me a beer and then a little while later I asked for another drink, and in small talk, she proceeded to tell me she was the assistant manager, and I relayed the same thing to her about how I'd been there for a good thirty minutes before she had came back to the bar area., and she tesponded with \""Well , when nature calls, you gotta go, \u0026 the door shouldve been locked.\"" But i did press the buzzer b4 i tealized door was not licked. And i'm pretty patient, but I had pushed the button to get in the door which was unlocked, but either way, the buzzer had went off, but never was checked on until thirty plus minutes later. That could be dangerous for other customers at the bar or the bartender or anybody who is in the establishment. If I happen to be some crazy deranged person, not to mention the key was in the drawer of the till, which was left unattended, so if I was a robber, I could have clearly went right around the bar opened.The drawer and took all the money and she would not have been none the wiser just more of a safety issue than anything.But the atmosphere in that bar is quiet and peaceful and a good place to just go and relax and have a beer or two on my way to my home, Because I live near there.  I go there about once or twice a week, but usually on day shift or graveyard early a.m. and those 2 bartenders , Samantha, and I believe the male at night is Cody but not sure either way those two are efficient.

The staff is welcoming, attentive, and the overall vibe of the place is energetic. The menu is clean and easy to navigate, and the food pictures online look great. It’s also reasonably priced, especially for a spot right on the casino floor.\n\nBut when it comes to the food, unfortunately, it just didn’t deliver. The burger was a letdown—it lacked flavor, and the meat didn’t taste fresh. The nachos were another miss: the meat was tough, and the cheese didn’t melt well or blend with the chips. Everything tasted rushed and forgettable.\n\nThis place is big and always busy, so it honestly felt like the kitchen was just mass-producing food without much care for quality. Nothing we ordered felt special or satisfying.\n\nIf you’re looking for good service, quick bites, and a loud sports bar atmosphere, TAP checks those boxes. But if you're coming in for a memorable meal, you might want to explore other options at MGM.\n\nOverall, I’d give it 2 stars for the food, but props to the staff for their great hospitality."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgMDIoLKQsgE\u0026fid=0x0:0xdabe5b542be4a552""],""When"":""2025-4-6""},{""Name"":""Sue Chef"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0D3pXZ0GZCYf4zh-5FJH5u4zRxvwf3_MUT1ayqipePgp2o2_w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""If you're looking for a 5-star upscale hoity-toity ritzy Las Vegas experience, this is not your place.

We stopped in after our flight to town and just wanted some quick eats that didn't set us back the $$$$ that so many restaurants around here display (read that: boku bucks). We were pleasantly surprised! We had the chicken tacos (delish) and a Caesar salad (expected) with wine. The food and drinks came really fast (insert smiley face here) and the portions were large. But the delight was -- major shout out here -- KATT, our server. She was friendly, helpful and so personable! Table service (food deliverers and table clearers) were super friendly too. We ordered dessert to go, which was yummy later at the hotel but FYI the dessert portions are small. Good for us, but might be a disappointment to others and are not sharable size. All in all, this place is a 5-star *in its class.* It's a good tap bar with good tap-bar eats and treats. Atmosphere is relaxing and fun with TVs everywhere and a large open kitchen.

It was more than enough food for the 2 of us, but we do have smaller appetites. The bill ended up being $50 with tip, so we still had half of our credit left which we didn't even get to use.

Everything was fresh and the dressing wasn't just poured on the top, but the salad was tossed in it. The chicken was bite size. Delicious!\n\nOur server Mike was attentive and friendly. We enjoyed talking with him. He made us feel very comfortable. He is definitely an asset.\n\nThere are TV's everywhere to watch whatever game is playing.\n\nIt's a cool place. If we lived here it would be our home base.\n\nUpdate: We had breakfast the next morning here. Excellent! Miranda came to our table immediately and brought us coffee. She was friendly and welcoming  Our server was Bunny. She was so bubbly and happy that it was contagious. ☺️\n\nOur eggs, potatoes and Sourdough toast were perfect.

We were able to make a reservation off of Google maps when searching this spot. We also got to request which game we wanted to watch. There were plenty of screens and areas to watch and they set up your table area for your game. We originally had a reservation for 6 but they were accommodating and our party was as larger as 8-9 at a point. They have all American food here. I got the standard burger which came with 2 Pattie’s, for $6 more you could add an appetizer and a shale. So I got the spinach and artichoke dip and my friend took my vanilla milkshake. My friends also got onion rings, nachos, mashed potatoes. They allow you to sit there for the entire game and you don’t feel pressured to leave. They do charge for extra ranch.

I was lucky enough to come on a not so busy night but I’d definitely recommend placing a reservation in advance."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAyi8pPJZ94MgWNjplvucd-\u0026fid=0x0:0xc154d1d800aea095""],""When"":""2025-12-3""},{""Name"":""Marielle Irene dela Cruz"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBlR-3F3eTXb0brNsL3o4C5D2J6hwT5uRtf3bj2y9St6307H6o=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I came across a feature on this place on Facebook some time ago and since it’s not in my area, I waited to check it out. It finally crossed my mind again recently and as I found myself in Chinatown (Spring Mtn), I decided to grab an early dinner. Being by myself, I couldn’t order a lot but I couldn’t decide among the red and white sauce pizzas (plus, J noted they have wagyu carpaccio that my son would love for next time)! Ended up ordering BOTH a red sauce and a white sauce pizza to-go since I might as well. I only regret not taking my relatives here last month when they visited. The ingredients taste fresh, great quality pizzas, the crust is perfection and the customer service friendly. I only wish they were closer to my side of town. Either way, they are now on my list of favorite places to eat!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhBvQZKHL_2N7oUL-fmp33FN\u0026fid=0x0:0xc154d1d800aea095""],""When"":""2025-11-22""}]",null,
