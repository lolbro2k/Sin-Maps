I had checked out earlier in the day, ran a couple of errands, and realized I needed to charge my car, so I returned to the hotel I had just stayed at and hooked up to one of their chargers. I was actively paying for the electricity used.\n\nA staff member eventually came out, circled my car a few times, and then told me I wasn’t a guest and therefore wasn’t supposed to use the chargers. But I was a guest earlier that same morning, and nowhere around the charging stations does it clearly say “for guests only.” The whole interaction felt unnecessary and almost like profiling.\n\nThis experience left a really bad taste in my mouth.

Thats an extra star from me. The booking process is the problem. When I booked room from the the third party, it does not show if it is only shared room or not. It gave us option to book private room, when I checked in, the staffs told me there are only shared rooms for Bposhtels booking. I was not happy with that. If you partner with the third party booking, they or you must address that you only offer shared rooms. I was extremely unhappy sharing my private space with other people. I even offer to pay the mark up to get my own room but all rooms were full booked at that time. how unfortunate! I will never go back to your hostel.\n\nAnd the reservation procedure is a pain, or cancer tbh, cos my friend booked it for me under his name, he was willing to video call and do anything like offer to email his id to show his eligibility so i can get booked. The staffs couldnt do anything cos he had to be physically presented to check in which is very inconvenient to us. I know other hotel's, not hostel since this is my first time booking hostel, procedure is not that strict, they are willing to verify and be flexible. I had 3 other people/families that night facing the same problem as me and they were upset too. One is like me and another one is the different between their real name and English name. The call center was 24/7 but my case wasnt solved until the next morning which i must pay extra to get a temporary stay at the private room assuming i would get a private room after my case was solved without knowing i would get a shared room unless i googled or confirmed with that staff. How many people would do that? It almost ruins my whole trip and really stressed me out. I lost 1 night and my private room just becos your procedure sucks. I called Priceline for compesation but couldnt cancel becos other reasonable hotels were also fully booked. And i wish i could afford to stay at luxury hotels.\n\nAnd really? 6 people living in the tiny room. i was thinking 4 should be already crowded but 6. I know you want to maximum the profit but that is too much. Too greedy! It is like crush hour in the morning and night since we had to take turn to use the restroom, wasting our time just to wait for our turn instead of using that time for our traveling. I couldnt use the shower or sink at all during my stay and during our rush hour. I went to the airport and had clean up since i did not want to miss my departure flight. Too much, i really mean it, too much traffic in the room during rush hour.\n\nLesson learnt, I rather book a real hotel which is also not to high compared to your price.

I checked between the sheets before lying my 3-year-old in the bed and noticed there were multiple strands of brunette-colored hair throughout the king-sized bed which also matched hair along the walls of the shower. I brought my concerns to the front desk along with first the towels and later with the bedding. I was told that housekeeping would be informed to address the situation but nothing had been done to address the problem. Although I'd paid for 1 week I was forced to stay elsewhere for a night until I was able to pay to clean the bedding which I'd done the following day in the hotel's residence laundry room costing nearly $10. The hotel didn't have the amenities for the kitchen inside the room. I purchased my a.m. coffee from a diner the 1st two days of my stay because there were no coffee makers available in addition to that utensils to prepare meals and cups had to be purchased as well to safely store and drink my coffee. This experience was the worst I've experienced. The reason for booking a suite with a kitchenette seemed to be more cost-efficient than one without. I could have stayed elsewhere with a comp breakfast and a properly cleaned room near the same location and saved approximately 100+ dollars.

It’s close to the Las Vegas Convention Center, which is incredibly convenient during a packed NFR schedule, and it’s also easy to get to restaurants, shopping, and everything else Vegas offers. Another huge plus is that some rooms include full kitchens, which is a game changer for multi-week stays. Being able to cook real food, store groceries, and not eat takeout for every meal makes a noticeable difference.\n\nThat said, there are a few ongoing drawbacks. There seems to be quite a bit of staff turnover, and newer team members aren’t always familiar with the property or the little nuances that repeat guests come to know after staying here multiple years. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s noticeable if you’ve been coming back year after year like our same group has.\n\nAnother con is the consistent F1 teardown noise, which often happens overnight on the streets around the hotel, honestly was not as bad this year as its been in the past 5 years. Additionally, the pool and hot tub area has been “under construction” for the last two years. We were just there last week, and it was essentially a full rubble pile. Hopefully that means real progress is finally happening and it’ll be completed by spring or summer 2026 — because that would be a big improvement.\n\nAll in all, it’s still a dependable option for NFR / time in Las Vegas, especially if you value location and having a kitchen / larger space. I think it’ll be even better once renovations are finished."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jackmason69"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/local-reviews/AJMZ0Qdx0CtChWdL4amzhVtedU6JgNzs3A9KzPS8K998c7-u-mDeTb-7WQwuTD-PPX6BcVA5wg=s120-c-br100"",""Rating"":0,""Description"":""The hotel was just off the main strip but close enough to walk to .

The rooms are LESS than substandard. I wouldn't leave my DOG IN THESE ROOMS! OYO Hotels has acquired these run down motel properties and continues to rent rooms out here when they KNOW that these properties are dilapidated, old and run down. They should be ASHAMED of themselves for even keeping this property and the one down the street open. The bed was at least 15 years old, the blankets were old and stained, the room smelled horrible and the manager went in and sprayed some Odor Ban in the room to mask the horrible smell! The bathroom had mold and broken tiles in it. Words just cannot describe how bad this room looked. After he sprayed the room, I could not even stay in it because of the fumes! I spent about an hour walking up and down Las Vegas Blvd looking for another room and when I found one, I returned to this property and told them there was NO WAY I was staying in that room. I turned in the key and left. I was also charged a mysterious $50 \""admin feee\"" when I checked in although the room had been prepaid online. I was told I would \""only\"" be charged $20 for the deposit which was usually $100. FOR THIS DUMP?!?! I have contacted OYO Hotels and they say I cannot get a refund. I have also contacted my credit card company to dispute the charges. PLEASE do not be fooled by this property. OYO Hotels is a run down, old, dirty motel that I wouldn't keep my dog in.

We looked around and stumbled onto this Peanut Butter Whisky bottle and inquired further. Brian told us it wasn’t as sweet as others you may have tried (i.e. Skrewball) as it’s small batch created, has real peanuts, and is sweetened with real sugar cane (not high fructose corn syrup). Brian gave us a sample and we were SOLD! Bought their biggest bottle 750ml! Shared it with close friends and that bottle was the hit of the night! We’ll be sipping on the remains back in San Diego during special occasions. If you like peanut butter, this makes for a great shot drink or a sipping whiskey. The Vegas store is well stocked, tidy, stress-free, and the staff is wonderful (especially Brian who helped us). He personalized the bottle for us and put a cute bow on it and wrapped it carefully so as to protect it during transit.

The lack of selection is rather frustrating I will be honest with you about that. The prices aren't too bad. However you have to watch out because they like to sell discontinued products for bargain prices. So there's no telling if the products are even remotely close to being at the best that they could be. This last experience was one of the worst experiences I had in there. I'm not sure if this was an owner or manager or what his deal was. I handed him a quarter and he refused to take it. Claiming it was too dirty.you could see that it was a quarter it was just a little bit darker. I took it to a different store and they took it with no problem.

Most items feel more like symbolic trinkets than something useful, and the quality varies a lot.

We’ve read about this place a while back and decided to go check it out. We were NOT disappointed! Everything was just as the great reviews said.\n\nThe Atmosphere\nThis is quintessential old Vegas charm - a little hole-in-the-wall bar that feels like stepping back in time. Don’t let the modest exterior fool you; this place has character in spades. The intimate setting creates a cozy, neighborhood bar vibe that’s become increasingly rare on the Strip.\n\nSecurity \u0026 Service\nThe staff maintains a professional approach with security checks for weapons and ID at entry, but everyone is super nice once you’re inside. The friendly atmosphere makes you feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door.\n\nDrinks \u0026 Pricing\nHere’s where Stage Door really shines - the prices are unbeatable for Las Vegas:\n- **$5 Jack and Coke**\n- **$5 Whiskey and Coke**\n- **$1 Beers**\n-***$2 Hotdogs\n\nAnd this isn’t watered-down tourist trap liquor - you’re getting REAL, quality alcohol at these prices. In a city where drinks can easily cost $15-20 elsewhere, these prices are practically unheard of.\n\nGaming\nWhile it’s a small bar, they have gaming machines right at the bar where you can try your luck while sipping your affordable drinks. We both played the machines and had a great time, though we kept our expectations realistic.\n\nThe Verdict\nIt’s really a great experience that captures authentic Vegas spirit. The combination of incredibly affordable drinks, friendly service, and genuine local atmosphere makes this place special. Don’t skip it if you’re looking for a break from the corporate casino scene!\n\n**Perfect for**: Budget-conscious visitors, locals, anyone seeking authentic Vegas character\n**Skip if**: You prefer upscale casino environments or need extensive gaming options\n\nBottom Line:Stage Door Casino and Bar proves that sometimes the best Vegas experiences come in the smallest packages.

M's is a hidden jewel that needs better street signage to draw in customers. It's very nice and new inside with a great location on Tropicana and Arville. In between The Orleans hotel \u0026 casino and the Budget Suites on Tropicana. I've meet friendly and helpful staff there. They have a very good selection of wine and liquor. They've improved on a greater selection of food. Being the only grocery store within walking distance. They have capitalized on that, with a wider and better selection of food for the workers in the offices within the building. They now have a grill to cook hamburgers etc...The prices are fairly reasonable. A gallon of milk is around $5.50 in an open air cooler. Milk should be in the beverage cooler to last longer.

The atmosphere hums with quiet confidence. Soft lighting, marble surfaces, and an extensive wine wall create an inviting ambiance even before the first dish arrives at the table.\n\nI ordered the Wally Burger, a dish that truly lives up to its reputation with each bite. The half-pound Black Hawk American Wagyu comes perfectly cooked, rich without being overwhelming. The patty is deeply flavorful, showcasing the unmistakable silkiness of Wagyu, and is beautifully complemented by Artikas smoked Gouda, which adds depth without dominating the palate. Caramelized onions provide sweetness, heirloom tomatoes contribute freshness, and butter lettuce keeps the overall structure light. The signature Wally's sauce ties everything together with subtlety. Nothing is overpowering; it's indulgent but well-balanced. This is a burger for those who appreciate proportion.\n\nAcross the table, the Salmon Avocado Toast demonstrated that refinement isn't limited to meat dishes. The smoked salmon is delicate and clean, layered over creamy smashed avocado. The poached eggs are cooked perfectly, their yolks providing richness without heaviness. Basil pesto introduces a gentle herbal note, while shaved green asparagus adds texture and a pleasing crispness. It's thoughtful, carefully composed, and far more elegant than the name suggests.\n\nWally's truly excels in its wine selection. We paired our meal with both white and red wines, each carefully selected and poured with confidence. The white wine enhanced the smokiness of the salmon and cut through the richness of the avocado, while the red wine complemented the Wagyu, enhancing its depth instead of competing with it. Here, wine is not merely an accessory; it's an integral part of the dining experience.\n\nYes, dining here is expensive. There's no getting around that. However, Wally's doesn't apologize for its prices, and after the experience, it doesn't need to. The execution, ingredients, atmosphere, and service all justify the cost. This is dining for those who appreciate precision, quality, and the luxury of things done well.\n\nIs it pricey? Absolutely. Is it worth it? Without a doubt."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhA_ix41Un-OJHNqlXs0vDBv\u0026fid=0x0:0xc4145339ba99de7e""],""When"":""2026-2-1""},{""Name"":""Krista"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUYywUR3moU0chP_QDMvlllq9krBcgEPnZi3vKFhevs2zte0MQV=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We really liked the food.

He checked to see exactly what we'd ordered, asked what kind of wine we normally drink, and our budget. He gave us a couple of choices and directed us toward one after we asked us to. And he stayed under our budget. And the wine absolutely delicious and perfect for what we ordered. The charcuterie plate was really generous and has fun accompaniments.

Building was a little dated (no recycling bins or water refill stations), but had some architectural detail (albeit somewhat beige as well).\n\nNot a place I'd recommend or anything but also not a place to necessarily avoid.

The main one located in the Lobby is by far the largest with the widest selection and is open 24 hrs. What I liked best about this particular shop was that they had some refrigerated Prosecco whereas in the other essentials shops, they were all room temperature. Another shop is located near the Palace Tower and convention area. It is much smaller but offers a similar selection of goods. The last one was barely open during our stay and is located near the Augustus Tower. It is a shame it was always closed as it had some really cute bags in the window. All shops offer astronomically high priced gifts and basics like medicine, milk and feminine hygiene products. Expect to pay around $7 for a bottle or water and $15 for a small box of feminine items. These prices are high, but nowhere near what you’ll pay if you opt to eat anything from your room."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgICRk8Hv7gE\u0026fid=0x0:0xc9cff841db839049""],""When"":""2023-4-9""},{""Name"":""M Z"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJRt-QaHidtRPiQTNgTKHZFiNhgbYmvtSdGKwadObsHwHRppg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""No price tags?

My mother asked the female sales assistant if she could have an extra bag inorder to put 2 tshirts in one bag and the other in another bag so she could give gift with bag. This sales assistant ask if we are staying at this hotel. I said no. She said store policy is we get only one bag. We bought 3 shirts,, what business is it of her where I’m staying? On our way out we ought the robes at the other Emperoors Essential store who put each robe in a seperate bag.

this place was quite expensive for what you get, especially for someone with an average budget. We paid around $40 and change for just two slices of pizza, which felt overpriced for the portion and overall quality. Unfortunately, the taste was below average and didn’t really justify the cost.\n\nThe restaurant operates with a self-service setup, which is fine, but when prices are this high, you naturally expect a bit more in terms of food quality and overall value. The ambience itself is nice and modern, and the place looks appealing at first. However, it was very noisy inside, which made it less comfortable for actually sitting down and enjoying the meal.\n\nThis experience also made me feel that dining directly on the Las Vegas Strip may not be the best option if you’re looking for good value and flavorful food. You end up paying premium prices mostly for the location rather than the taste. If you go a little off the Strip, you can easily find much better food that is more reasonably priced and more satisfying.\n\nOverall, decent ambience but expensive for average food. I’d recommend exploring options outside the Strip for better taste and value."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAaeTKhEXyUAi-7hQl6UUcz\u0026fid=0x0:0x95732ce89a75e31c""],""When"":""2026-2-8""},{""Name"":""Adrianna Salazar"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXA5Pl9BEZHSpJOZhpipf8QCUPq8eeHgevkwRBlFN2l7sJ9hDQP=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""This spot is so conveniently located in Park MGM.\nWe went there numerous times during our stay so we got to try a bunch of different foods.\nIt was the fried pizza.

Which I responded with no… just the cigarettes..

When he finally spoke, his tone was shockingly rude, and things only got worse from there.\n\nI asked for a pack of Marlboro Blend No. 27 cigarettes, and he acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. I pointed them out, describing them clearly as the golden pack, third from the left on the row. Instead of assisting me, he just glared at me with a look that felt outright racist. It was clear from his demeanor and the way he was interacting with me that he was judging me based on something other than my request.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, he barked, “ID please!” I handed over my ID, but instead of processing it normally, he shouted at me again, demanding that I “HOLD MY COFFEE”—in an unnecessarily aggressive and demeaning tone.\n\nEven after I paid, his hostility continued. I’ve never been treated this poorly while making a simple purchase, and it was clear that his behavior stemmed from prejudice rather than any legitimate reason.\n\nTo the owners: Your shop benefits from a prime location on the Vegas Strip, surrounded by hotels and tourists. But employing staff members who are not only rude but openly racist will damage your reputation and drive customers away. I hope you take this issue seriously because no one should ever feel unwelcome or disrespected in your store."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgIDf7vWgdw\u0026fid=0x0:0x3bec9fcdaf145de9""],""When"":""2025-1-6""}]",null,,7

We started with appetizers while waiting for the rest of our group, and initially everything was going well. As the restaurant got busier, however, the service became quite slow—which I understand can happen, especially in Las Vegas.\n\nOverall, the food was okay. The pizza was good—nothing exceptional, but reasonable for a restaurant close to the Strip.\n\nThe main issue that really bothered me was with my order. I ordered two Calabrese pizzas, one of them specifically with no pork at all. Unfortunately, it was served with pork not once, but twice. The manager did come over and asked if it was okay, and I explained that it was not. He offered to reorder it, which I appreciated, but by the time a third pizza would have been ready, my colleagues had already finished their meals. I thanked him and declined the remake, sharing slices from friends instead.\n\nThe manager mentioned that the item would be removed from the bill, but later I realized it was not. That was very disappointing and honestly disturbing, especially after the mistake was acknowledged.\n\nIn summary, the food was acceptable, but the service and handling of this situation left us unhappy. I hope this feedback helps improve the experience for future guests, especially when it comes to dietary requests and billing accuracy."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAQvz50Jcc6C1PP9tNLLWEv\u0026fid=0x0:0xcdfa5bc101c4f42""],""When"":""2026-1-26""},{""Name"":""Michelle Martinez"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXTKJkO-D6tX3dligpU3Da1T8a-3Dqa6IHceT2qwa_69P7VeL5k4A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Accidentally stumbled into this spot and am I happy we did!

The parma was delicious! The rich creaminess of the ricotta offset the saltiness of the prosciutto. I also enjoyed the vampire pizza but was slightly disappointed at the amount of sausage, maybe 3 on the whole pizza. Still very tasty other than that.

Well, a seat was arranged, and was asked to move over a seat again to get more somebody else accompanied to a group. That was the kicker, that somebody was a \""dog\"". This dog was put on a bar seat, and soon later was drinking water out of a pan. At least the dog behaved better than its loud mouth owner. Non of the employees did anything about this situation. This was really ridiculous and I would never expect that in a place like that.

Well I can tell you they haven’t. Me and my female friend entered the bar late one night to get a drink and keep our night going. Upon entering the staff was extremely friendly and lively and welcoming, especially Paul and Colby. They asked us if we knew about their current promotion and how it worked so we could get a good deal. As we sat at the bar top a group of two males and two females who all looked like they were in the mid 40’s attempted to get my attention. I turned over to them and they began to ask extremely sexual and inappropriate questions about my friend and if we were in the mood to party. Instead of reacting out of anger and this situation leading to a worse one I told them off and said leave us alone. They didn’t like this and proceeded to make degrading and negative sexual comments about myself and my friend. I immediately notified our bartender who reacted promptly and notified the bar manager. The bar manager then approached the guests who of course denied everything and in a dramatic and obvious move of being caught in the act got up and left the bar. Then I noticed the bar manager get on his phone. After talking with the staff we were told these were regulars at the bar. The team did apologize for their behavior and made it clear that it is not okay for anyone to be doing this to any other patrons. We continued to enjoy our drinks and shortly after the owner showed up welcoming back in the regulars who had just gotten kicked out. He spent about 20min speaking with them and laughing. Not once did he come over to me and my friend to apologize to us or explain why he felt it to be okay to allow such guests back in while we were still here. If this is the type of regulars this owner allows then it speaks volumes for the lack of consideration and care he has of any other business. Once again the staff did a great job checking in on us and in the end taking care of the bill as a sign of good will; which they did not have to do at all."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",null,,3

Strip and in the mood for bucket drinks and greasy in the best way food, Dirt Dog Bar absolutely understands the assignment.\n\nWe stopped in and tried several of the bucket drinks (because when in Vegas... obviously), and they were fun, strong, and exactly what you want when you're committing to novelty sized cocktails.\n\nWe also grabbed a dirty chili dog, and honestly? It was delicious. Messy, flavorful, and perfectly salty exactly the kind of food you need to balance out those drinks. This is not fine dining, and it's not trying to be. It's comfort food meant to soak up alcohol, and it does that job very well.\n\nThe location is super convenient right behind Ole Red in the walkable shops. There's bar seating both outside and inside a small building, and ordering is easy: you grab drinks at the bar and order food from the kitchen tucked just behind the bar area.\n\nBonus highlight: Ryan had to grab a photo with Snoop, because obviously you don't skip that moment when it presents itself.\n\nDirt Dog Bar is fun, casual, and exactly what you want when you're already in Vegas mode. Great drinks, solid food, easy location, and zero pretension.\n\nPerfect stop when you're ordering bucket drinks and need something greasy, satisfying, and reliable to go with them."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhBlbg56_yXhkwMy2dxK6BoL\u0026fid=0x0:0x5d9924400e73cc38""],""When"":""2026-1-25""},{""Name"":""Tierra Jones"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWaL05CuvoJGrR9HlY6okbuxcP1u4527UzIeBNBY8h8hJuYc7fp0Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Let me say I came alllll the way from Indianapolis to try this place !

did a private mixology class to celebrate a 21st birthday - the class was amazing!  Delicious and unique cocktails waiting when we got there, and the ambiance in the room was a great mix between cozy and classroom.  The instructor Daniel was a wealth of enthusiasm and knowledge and wove information between stories effortlessly.  The second cocktail we made was one we all agreed was one of the tastiest any of us have ever had, and when he realized one person in the group had an allergy to an ingredient he pivoted and she got the same hands on instruction with a special drink just for her.  If we could have stayed longer we would have and we all walked away grinning from ear - with our third drink 'to go' which for how strong the others were in the time, was nice to not feel we had to 'chug'.  This activity was a highlight of a weekend PACKED with special events.

People walk slowly, soaking in every spark, every sign, every breath of the Vegas night.\n\nOverhead, the Big Apple Coaster slices through the sky like a streak of red fire 🎢🔥, giving the whole place a heartbeat of thrill and movement — as if the city itself were alive and teasing you.\n\nInside the hotel, the casino, bars, and restaurants feel like little neighborhoods of New York.

The evening began positively, and the service was very good. Unfortunately, as midnight approached, the situation deteriorated rapidly.\n\nWhen guests began moving toward the patio, only approximately half of the patio was open, which caused severe overcrowding. During this rush, my daughter was pushed and knocked to the ground. My son-in-law and I were also pushed and nearly involved in a physical altercation with an individual who did not have a VIP pass but was attempting to force access onto the patio.\n\nDespite the obvious crowd control and safety issues, security staff did nothing to intervene. When we attempted to explain what had occurred, we were made to feel as though we were the problem rather than victims of an unsafe situation. As a result, we did not see the fireworks we paid to attend and felt unsafe remaining on the premises, so we left.\n\nWhat should have been a memorable New Year’s Eve with my family instead became one of the worst New Year’s experiences we have ever had.\n\nAfter leaving, we called to file a complaint. The individual who answered was dismissive and stated that she doubted the incident even happened. This response was extremely unprofessional and compounded an already unacceptable experience.\n\nI am submitting this complaint not only because of the poor experience, but because of the serious safety concerns involved. Overcrowding, lack of crowd control, and dismissive responses to guest injuries are issues that should be taken very seriously.\n\nI would appreciate a response from management addressing this incident and explaining how situations like this are handled, particularly for guests who purchase VIP access.\n\nSincerely,\nBuddy Swisshelm"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Jennyleen Dy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX9L5V_b3-PwZuRL0323GFZ4oBt7dCXI1nJGf6UZH3weDmVScrF=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Ghostbar was an unforgettable experience!

The truffle fries were crispy with a strong truffle flavor and disappeared fast.\n\nFor mains, we tried the margherita pizza and mushroom pizza. Both had thin, crispy crusts and fresh toppings—the margherita was light and balanced, while the mushroom pizza was rich and savory. The chicken wings were well-cooked and flavorful, making them another easy favorite.\n\nTo drink, the coffee martini, scorched melon, and piña spritz were all well-presented and refreshing, each offering a different flavor profile depending on what you’re in the mood for.\n\nOverall, Yard House delivered a fun, casual dining experience with a wide variety of food and drinks, making it a good choice for groups who want to try a little bit of everything."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhB6JsXLd-yQCmyVVrPSskUv\u0026fid=0x0:0x6cd08527af5bcaa0""],""When"":""2025-12-29""},{""Name"":""ozitheexplorer"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXe7IfckE5yW33Uc37xY5D8cKjMF_rwv4oyvgddSFfI1uWoi4E=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The location is very good and place is comfortable.

The host at the podium confirmed we were a party of two.  She then asked if we wanted a table or to sit at the bar. We quickly decided to sit at the bar , our new favorite for some reason.  We reviewed the menu and the food and beer options were pretty extensive. We quickly made our choices for drinks and food.  I ordered a Space Dust from Elysian and Wifey kept it simple with a lemonade. For food she ordered the Loaded Tater Tots and I opted for the Chicken Quesadilla, which came with chopped chicken. Yard House had plenty of screens scattered around to watch all the games.  I found out the restrooms are on the second floor. When I went upstairs, it looked kind of deserted, probably because it was off-hours. The food came out pretty quickly and looked super fresh. We started digging in, and everything was delicious.

We also had delicious passed appetizers that I wish I had more pictures of, but they went so quickly I completely missed my chance. The bartenders inside the Ice Bar were awesome and my guests raved about them then and continue to talk about their stellar service now. The drinks were delicious, the energy was electric, and the ambiance was everything we could’ve hoped for. I also feel the time we were given for the event space was perfect for a welcome party- I we didn’t feel like we were rushed at all, and it also didn’t feel like we had so much time it dragged past its glory.\nWe are so grateful to Candace and Marc who helped us plan the event so that it went off without a hitch, and to the wonderful servers and bartenders who made the experience what it was.

It was classy, confusing, and cost more than my first car payment. The bartender looked like he should have a PhD in mixology and minor in psychology because he could see my financial anxiety.\n\nNext up, the Cozumel Spicy Margarita. It’s not just spicy — it’s like being kissed by a jalapeño and gently slapped by a pineapple. 10/10 would cry again.\n\nSomeone ordered the Havana Rum Old Fashioned for Two at the next table. It came out like a Vegas magic trick — smoke, passionfruit bonbon, and all. The couple looked like they’d just been proposed to by Bacardi itself.\n\nThe décor? Imagine if Gatsby, Versace, and a peacock got together for brunch. The lighting makes everyone look 30% more attractive and 70% more mysterious.\n\nWould I come back? Absolutely.

Instead, the environment was extremely quiet, and it felt like even normal conversation was discouraged.\n\nWe’re from the South and naturally tend to speak louder than we realize. That was apparently taken as a sign that we were intoxicated. After being served one drink, the bartender refused to serve us any additional drinks without explanation or warning. We were not disruptive, belligerent, or visibly drunk — just talking.\n\nThe service felt unwelcoming and unnecessarily strict. For a Las Vegas bar, this was shocking. Being cut off after one drink simply for speaking made us uncomfortable and frustrated.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun, relaxed, or even normal Vegas bar experience, I strongly recommend going elsewhere.

We asked around and found out Breeze Bar, which was right next to the hotel registration that they had hot water. We told the bar tender we were staying at the hotel and asked for two cups of hot water. Nevertheless, the bar tender lady, the one with blond curly hair who's in her 40-50's jumped up to her feet, yelled at us, said very loudly, \""I'm going to charge you for hot water!\""\n\nIt was such a huge \""surprise\"" to us that a bar tender shouting at us for asking for hot water! We were so shocked at this lady's attitude that we were speechless for a few seconds. Still, we said calmly, \""Front desk told us to come here to get hot water.\"" The mid-age blond curly hair lady remained very rude, \""Go get hot water from them!\""\n\nIt's not that the bar charges for hot water that's shocking, it's this blond curly hair lady's attitude towards the hotel guest.

I have to give them credit for the Mai Tai specifically. They kept it traditional instead of drowning it in pineapple juice.\n\nThe real highlight was the service. Our bartender, Benny, was fantastic. He managed a packed bar and service tickets without breaking a sweat, all while making us feel welcome. We even tested him with a La Louisiane (an off-menu New Orleans classic) and he nailed it.\n\nCome for the photos, but stay because Benny and the team are running a top-tier bar."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhC8lObCf60NC_rotvxZM7CK\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c123f8d8c6b91d5""],""When"":""2026-1-20""},{""Name"":""Pam Delfino"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVou97WNj_X-lZ_I6WAUZr7ELzzqVVEd-LYy7ydp9dEDslErRA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Gorgeous, luxurious lounge with spectacular views of the Strip!

I had spent about 20 minutes waiting in line to confirm the details of my scheduled prenatal massage, specifically asking whether they would use the special prenatal pillow with a hollow for the tummy, which I had been assured twice would be provided. The pillow was a deal-breaker for me because I don’t find side-lying massages effective in relieving tension, especially in my neck and shoulders.\nI made it clear that I rely on proper pressure release through simultaneous massage from both sides of the back to ease the tension. When massage is done only on one side, the other side gets squeezed, which is not only uncomfortable but counterproductive. So, I was extremely disappointed when I arrived for my massage and discovered there was no special pillow after all.\nTo make matters worse, I was promised that the manager would come to speak with me about the issue, but no one ever arrived. It’s frustrating when you’re promised a certain experience and it doesn’t meet expectations, especially when you’ve communicated your needs clearly. I left feeling dissatisfied and let down by the lack of follow-through on their part.

The lady could only tell me it was a system glitch and i would need to wait 7 to 10 business days to see my refund back . Keep in mind room was perfect and the well fridge had never been touched ??

When I approached her she stated “we did our best to accommodate you at the bar with the refund and I didn’t know you had a reservation over here.” The hostess advised her we had already been waiting and Nicole mentioned something about a POS system. The hostess then apologized to us and stated she could seat my party of 3 in a cramped area. Nicole offered no apologies, accommodations, or accountability. Nicole then proceeded to contact security, David, to say there was a “verbal altercation” to which all of the staff and witnesses denied including Payton (hostess), Bella(waitress), and Cher (bartender) who was amazing given the circumstances.

The security staff treated us with zero respect. They accused us of having fake IDs, pulled us out of the line, and made us show extra documents, visas, social media accounts, even apps on our phones to “prove” we were real. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nThere were five security guards against two women who were doing nothing wrong. People around us were watching and even defending us because the situation made no sense. At first they let us stay in line, then pulled us out again just to say no, then after 10 minutes of rude behavior they suddenly decided we “could” enter. One of them even walked away with my ID, so we had to wait while they kept treating us badly.\n\nWe spoke with the head of security. He apologized and offered to let us in with free drinks, but after the way we were treated, we chose not to enter. We also told our group not to come.\n\nThe worst part is that we went to Hakkasan and Marquee the nights before, also Tao Group venues, with the same security teams, and we had amazing nights with no problems. We even showed the stamps and wristbands from those clubs to prove it. Nothing we said mattered. They even claimed we “weren’t the same people” because we used our middle names, and questioned our last names despite having multiple official documents verified by the U.S. Department of State.\n\nWe also spoke with Edson, the promoter who put us on the guest list. He was kind, apologized, and tried to help, but the damage was already done.\n\nI left disappointed and honestly shocked. Our previous nights with Tao Group were great, but this experience at Omnia was unfair, disrespectful, and completely unnecessary. Avoid this place if you don’t want to deal with that kind of treatment."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhA9w_S6I2liGFGFtOoWtEQh\u0026fid=0x0:0x7fe4c6478a6de758""],""When"":""2025-11-17""},{""Name"":""Nattawoot Maneetorn"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjURKTpIMhyzjLJBGPeP72OqjmzRvQTgJ6eRf958vA2KAPlB_us=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This pub has an amazing vibe—stylish, lively, and truly inviting.

I went to see DJ Zedd, and locating his performance area was a nightmare.\n\nWhen I finally found it, the space was completely overcrowded. Security guards were blocking access, and if you wanted in, they demanded extra payment — $60 or more! It’s outrageous to have to bribe your way into a space you already paid for.\n\nThe dance floor was packed beyond capacity. There’s no crowd control, and it feels like they oversell tickets without limits. You end up begging for access while staff treat you with disrespect.

A jaw-dropping performance of “Iris” by the Goo Goo Dolls. That “I just want you to know who I am” line hit like a freight train and the whole place was singing along.

From the moment we sat down, everything felt right. The vibe is classic Vegas with a neighborhood twist — dark wood, red leather booths, and just enough clatter from the casino floor to remind you where you are, but never loud enough to kill the conversation.Let’s talk about the food, because wow.The 40 layer lasagna (first photo) is hands-down one of the best I’ve ever had, anywhere. Perfectly prepared, still light and crisp, layered with a bright, chunky marinara that actually tastes like tomatoes and a blanket of melted mozzarella and Parmesan that pulls apart in those glorious cheese strings. They finish it with fresh basil and a little extra grated Parm tableside. Served sizzling in its own little cast-iron skillet, it’s pure comfort on a plate.Then came the Short Rib Gnocchi in a truffle cream sauce (second photo). Little pillows of potato gnocchi that somehow manage to be fluffy and toothsome at the same time, tossed with tender shreds of braised short rib and earthy mushrooms. The truffle cream is rich but not overwhelming — you taste the truffle, not just smell it. A few leaves of fresh basil on top cut through the decadence perfectly. I’m still thinking about this dish days later.Service was warm, knowledgeable, and genuinely excited about the food — our server could tell we were food nerds. Cocktails are strong and classic (the Negroni was spot-on), and the wine list has plenty of great Italian and California bottles at reasonable Vegas markups.If you’re tired of overpriced, underwhelming “celebrity chef” spots on the Strip, do yourself a favor and head straight to Alexxa’s. It’s the kind of place where you walk in hungry and leave ridiculously happy, already planning your next visit. 11/10, will be back every trip."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAE8rzGygrDvCC5W-8QGhN6\u0026fid=0x0:0xbabb8c203abf5fb0""],""When"":""2025-11-23""},{""Name"":""Reed"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXCa5blgHKhPxLKCKgB6FBYdg0r1XFkB_AlxMNz4KPV1jMkjGeQWA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very nice place open to Las Vegas Blvd but part of the Paris casino.

I was a little confused and asked why. The hostess tried to explain but I didn’t really understand. I assumed it was either a hold on my card or like they were opening a tab. Not uncommon at dive bars (a little uncommon at fancy cocktail bars but whatever, I wasn’t too concerned). A few days later I look at my bank statement and I see two charges to my card! One around $80 which I believe is my bill and about her mystery charge around $70.\n\nI try to call the bar but after about 20 min on the phone getting transferred around the phone tree of the Venetian I get to the voicemail of the bar manager. I left a message but never heard back.\n\nUPDATE:\nThey did get back to me and refunded the duplicate charge after I emailed her directly, which I appreciate. That said, it took too much effort on my part — calling around, leaving voicemails, waiting for a response — just to get back money I shouldn't have been charged in the first place.\n\nAside from the billing issue, I just didn’t find the bar that impressive.

The food overall was good, I mean everything was cooked well and some of the flavors of things I didn’t love overall we really enjoyed our meal. My husband had a mojito flight and I had the frozen margarita flight, both were good I truly loved the prickly pear margarita! Then for dinner we shared the slider, shrimp, wing, and french fry flights. On each of the flights there were 2 we really liked and 1 we didn’t really love but like I said overall really tasty food. We ended with the cheesecake flight which was perfect to share and fun to see if we agreed on the best of the 3 flavors.

What came out was all drumettes with only one flat. If you can’t do all flats,doing the opposite is just bizarre.  Wings delivered. No napkins and no plates to share our appetizer.\n\nService was extremely inattentive. As a lifelong hospitality person, I understand the business and I had to get up to get napkins myself, and then when my salad arrived we still didn’t have silverware, so I had to track down a busser to get utensils. No one checked on us or noticed we were needed basic things.\n\nThey also never cleared plates, so our table was covered and there wasn’t room for the rest of our food. I literally had to put baskets on the floor just to make space, which is gross and not something a paying customer should have to do.\n\nTo top it off, the check included a surcharge $4.99 and then the tip suggestions start at 18%. Between the  fee and the lack of service, that felt pretty insulting.\n\nFood was fine, but the service and the extra charges ruined the experience. I wouldn’t come back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhA3gXEVfQxLn4Y-HtBYTxSp\u0026fid=0x0:0xb8d44bf04ca1715b""],""When"":""2025-12-30""},{""Name"":""David Nugent"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVbYQWpuuzZ2MrKwIevYmohzLDWDgA06jrA4MPBksB32OHvJkV-sg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Traditional breakfast for $15.99 for 2 eggs 2 bacon OR 2 sausage and some chopped potatoes is not good value $4.99 for a soda.

In previous visits, we consistently enjoyed an outstanding dining experience that reflected the high standards expected from a Celebrity Chef–branded restaurant.\nUnfortunately, this most recent visit fell well below those expectations. While prices have noticeably increased, the quality of the food did not reflect that change. In fact, the overall dining experience was subpar and not in line with the standards we have come to expect—nor with the reputation of this brand. The Garbage Can Brisket Nachos,  and the Mac Daddy chicken sandwich in particular, were extremely disappointing and did not represent the quality or creativity associated with Guy Fieri’s name.\nThe Nachos were cold, soft, and the brisket if you could find it amongst the beans was hard. The macaroni and cheese in the Mac Daddy was just a cold blob.\nThat said, The hostess, Faith, was exceptional. She provided beautiful customer service, was genuinely apologetic, and handled the situation with professionalism and grace. She truly represented the brand well—unfortunately, the food did not.\nThis experience left us wondering whether the leadership behind the brand is fully aware of what is currently being served at this Las Vegas location.\nWe hope this feedback is taken seriously, as we have always enjoyed this restaurant and would like to see it return to the level of quality it once consistently offered."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDshfOboGhFNnwNreOpjOuT\u0026fid=0x0:0x3eb1bc39e7cbf57f""],""When"":""2025-12-22""},{""Name"":""Aaron Linsdau Thriller Author"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBktHZmppMeg7ijsgru__TfFiLzI80rYJdBwXVt1wGbupwKj8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""As a thriller and romance author attending an Author convention in Vegas, I appreciate this restaurant.\nThe Guy Fieri restaurant between the Horseshoe and Paris hotels is one of my favorite stops during my thriller and romance author convention trips.

I love the concept but did not really enjoy the food. The quality of the food was pretty low and it was definitely lacking in flavor. I wouldn’t expect to get gourmet food at a $19.99 buffet but this was pretty drab. They have several items that qualify for the $19.99 all you can eat but a few items like the chicken and waffles and avocado toast have a charge of $5.00 and if you’re with a group of 4 and one person orders those items then everyone at the table gets charged $24.99 to avoid sharing. I decided to look past this and go ahead and order the chicken and waffles and I was really disappointed. The fried chicken had way too much batter and not enough (if any) seasoning and the waffle wasn’t impressive either. If you want a lot of food but aren’t necessarily worried about it being any better than someplace like Denny’s then this is probably a good option. The server was very sweet but the place was super busy and the food took a really long time to arrive. We had made reservations so we didn’t have to wait long for a table but I saw a lot of people waiting and then leaving because it was taking way too long to be seated.

There was plenty of consommé and lime juice to add extra flavor to this meal, which complimented the meat and salty fried cheese.

(if you don't have it, download it immediately, great restaurant app) We were in Vegas for the New Year and got to Vegas a couple days early so we stopped by, a GREAT decision.  It's a cool speakeasy style bar with a dive bar feel, but way nicer.  It's secluded inside some business buildings and it's very unassuming from the outside.  Once inside though, they got chill music playing on the record player, cool lounge chairs and couches and an ultra cool bar, like something from the 70's.  Retro and cool. Everyone was super nice and welcoming, especially Ross, who took great care of us at the bar.  They specialize in craft cocktails and boy were they delicious.  We had their Tiki drinks and they were refreshing and well-balanced with fresh fruit juice and rum.  The Prosciutto Tower, made with their homemade chips, perfectly savory prosciutto and a house made sauce was OUTSTANDING.  We also ordered their steaks and they were absolutely juicy, tender and packed with flavor.

It’s built on perfectly toasted bread with a generous layer of creamy, ripe avocado, then topped with silky, smoky salmon that adds rich flavor without feeling heavy at all. Balanced, fresh, and really well done. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich with biscuit, gravy, egg, chicken, and bacon purely because he was ogling the plate of the guy sitting next to him, who convinced him to order it. He definitely enjoyed it, but OMG that thing was huge! We also shared a side of Brussels sprouts, which were excellent. I’ll admit, I was hesitant to come here at first because I assumed Southern food might be too heavy for breakfast or brunch, but I was completely mistaken.

The speakeasy well-balances the “secretive” aspect without making it too difficult to find. On my visit on a Saturday night, there was a bouncer and velvet rope outside the barbershop, so it was pretty clear where to queue, but it was exciting to walk through the barbershop through two “secret” doors and finally see the cocktail lounge. I also loved that, while the space is not huge and it was a Saturday night, I wasn’t hurried; in fact, I was encouraged to stick around for the live band that would be playing later. I had an Old Fashioned with was mixed perfectly with my preferred bourbon. It was about $20 which is the basically the current going rate in Vegas for a classic cocktail and considering the atmosphere I was honestly surprised it didn’t cost more. Speaking of the atmosphere, it is simply outstanding (see photos of the bar and decor). The professional and classy experience continued to the very end, and I must give a shoutout to Vincent who escorted me to the exit and graciously thanked me for visiting.

The band was awesome and even asked me if there was a song request I had . I did , and it was the first song they played .  They also called  out to  or group several times during the night.\n\nOnce they got going our group was on fire!!\n\nThanks to Ziggy and the band whose name escapes me for being so interactive with our group , and for the awesome music !\n\nLast but certainly not least the staff was amazing!\nFrom Security , Khalil , Franklin , and Vincent were very kind to all of us , making us feel welcome with our interactions at the door and during the night.

I ordered the Hot Honey Margarita, which was neither hot nor sweet — it tasted like a basic margarita. For apps, we tried the goat cheese balls and the pigs in a blanket. They looked fine, but the flavours were surprisingly basic. Honestly, I had better appetizers at the Cheesecake Factory earlier that day.\n\nService was just okay. It took a few minutes just to get water, and our server took quite a while to get to our table in general, which didn’t help the overall experience.\n\nPinky’s definitely delivers on the hype and aesthetic — and as a VPR and Beverly Hills fan, I fully understand the appeal — but I was hoping Lisa’s impeccable taste would shine through in the food, drinks, and service.

For Thanksgiving dinner, we saved Hell’s Kitchen—only to be met with a shockingly poor and dismissive experience from our server that left us feeling unwelcome and disappointed.\n\nHoping to salvage the last night of our trip, we chose Pinky’s by Vanderpump, and it turned out to be the best decision we could have made.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, Desiree (Des) made us feel truly seen, valued, and welcomed—exactly what we needed after the previous night’s treatment. She is extraordinary: warm, attentive, effortlessly charismatic, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. Every recommendation she made was perfect, and her enthusiasm and sincerity completely transformed our evening.\n\nMiguel was equally amazing—friendly, professional, and attentive in a way that elevated the entire atmosphere. The teamwork between Des and Miguel created a level of hospitality we rarely encounter anywhere. They didn’t just give great service—they redeemed the end of our Thanksgiving trip and reminded us what genuine hospitality feels like.\n\nThe assistant manager, Joseph B., also came by to check on us, adding to an already flawless experience. Between the attentive service, the exquisite food, and the thoughtfully crafted drinks, everything at Pinky’s was exceptional. It says something that we enjoyed their birdcage charcuterie, pull-apart bread, and goat cheese balls a thousand times more than Hell’s Kitchen’s Beef Wellington.\n\nWe left feeling grateful, celebrated, and absolutely blown away by how much care and kindness these three brought to our night. Desiree, Miguel, and Joseph are shining examples of what makes the Vanderpump brand so special: elevated service, genuine warmth, and meticulous attention to detail that turns a meal into a memory.\n\nThey are the reason we will continue choosing Vanderpump establishments every time we’re in Las Vegas.\n\n— Jessica \u0026 Kathy"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDtFcK2IV42hstZSaLHQ_f5\u0026fid=0x0:0xc1216b4cc7b84f2e""],""When"":""2025-11-29""},{""Name"":""jeanette thul"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJv31uNwh1ezoBW0hq6imR-FgSKDhEBnczOMGnxy8_Zh49iHQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had a lovely experience at Pinky's!

partner and I had dinner reservations at Gilley’s in Treasure Island on Wednesday, December 17. We were excited for a relaxed meal, country music, line dancing, and maybe a ride on the mechanical bull. The whole evening turned into a lively, memorable night.\n\nWe arrived around 8:30 p.m. and the bar area was fairly quiet at first. We asked if we could eat in the bar even though our reservation was for the dining room. The security guard said yes, so we grabbed high top seats between the mechanical bull and the dance floor. After about ten minutes with no service, we decided to use our dining reservation instead.\n\nThe dining room was a pleasant surprise. We were seated right away, the hostess was warm, and our server was upbeat and attentive. As a vegetarian I had hoped for a spicy southwestern pasta, but the menu had limited plant-based choices. I ordered the Beyond Burger and fries. The burger was tasty and satisfying, though I would love to see more vegetarian options. My partner ordered the baked half chicken. The portion was generous and she loved it.\n\nAfter a relaxed dinner in a not too crowded dining room, we returned to the bar and took seats at the main bar for quicker service. The atmosphere picked up as the night went on. We enjoyed a few rounds of drinks and had a blast watching people line dance and two-stepping. The DJ mixed classic and modern country tunes and kept the energy high. The crowd was friendly and everyone seemed to be having a great time.\n\nWe had hoped to see the mechanical bull in action and maybe ride it. Unfortunately, the bull was not operating for our second visit in two years. It would be great if the bull’s hours were posted more clearly so guests can plan around it and not miss the show.\n\nOverall, we had a fantastic night. The food was good, the staff were friendly, and the entertainment was a lot of fun even without the bull. We always look forward to visiting Gilley’s when we are in Las Vegas. If you love country music and line dancing, Gilley’s is one of the best spots on the Strip."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAiiqH-W75WVtowLR0Zrz9I\u0026fid=0x0:0x2188e40631d1dec5""],""When"":""2026-1-18""},{""Name"":""陳宇"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK3Jps1iPCY7RZeadJEQ-ZKVOqYhLhNSZw62Wzu2DA3jme-IZI=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The menu design is suck—it's full of hidden traps that can easily lead to overcharging.

Cozy-chic — like a high-end cabin with cocktails instead of cocoa. My bartender, Heather, was friendly and totally on point.

We got there right at opening (noon) and were glad we had eaten beforehand.\n\nThe Vibe\n\nThis place is the perfect escape from all the craziness that is Vegas.

the Tilted Kilt for a light dinner and the Mac Daddy Flatbread seemed very intriguing so we gave it a try.\nSince Denise is a vegetarian we asked that the meat be served on the side and they were very accommodating.\nSorry about the photo not showing the entire flatbread, we dug in to our first slices pretty quickly.\nWe have to say that the Mac Daddy is an excellent flatbread. We’ve tried Cheeseburger Pizza at other places in the past but this beats those out hands down. The Ranch Dressing and Dill Pickles combine for an excellent flavor profile.\nBe adventurous. Give it a try.\nAs far as the restaurant, it was a friendly atmosphere as could be expected. I was surprised that it was not at all busy, but the benefit was that our food was delivered incredibly quickly."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhD6I81hUHBN8gkB_B0GqFPl\u0026fid=0x0:0xea0c13e1411878fb""],""When"":""2025-12-24""},{""Name"":""Robert Degnan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUVqP2fLIgSZwDV7OB_9pl7rEZjKsqQehPV2m904CtwmuUg_CqZsw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Came in on a Sunday.

It is quintessential Lisa Vanderpump: unapologetically opulent, slightly dramatic, and utterly gorgeous.\n\nThe attention to detail here is breathtaking. This isn't just a bar; it’s an indoor forest of romance. Looking up, you’re greeted by a lush canopy of flowers and twinkling lights cascading from the ceiling. Looking down, the floors and furniture feel like a high-end Parisian library met a moody garden party. Every square inch is a photogenic masterpiece, drenched in candlelight and oversized industrial-glam accents. It is the definition of \""floor-to-ceiling\"" fabulous.\n\nThe Vibe is sexy, sophisticated, and has that \""see and be seen\"" energy that only Vegas can provide. Whether you are a fan of *Vanderpump Rules* or just a fan of impeccable design, this spot is a 10/10.\n\nFinal Verdict: Put on your best outfit, grab your camera, and prepare to feel like royalty for an hour or two.

noticed is it’s darker than I expected. It’s got kind of a steakhouse vibe with the leather and the low light, but it’s made hip by the music and the creative lights. I meant to go for the social hour specials, but I accidentally made my reservation for a table, not the bar - my mistake. As a solo diner, I got seated at a 2 person table in The Vault (apparently all their rooms are named and themed, this one features an expensive looking piece of jewelery, but who cares). The next thing I noticed is that the staff is very nice and the appropriate level of attentive, not overbearing.\n\nI ordered the Zinfandel, grilled cheese dumplings, and Brussels. I had ordered the focaccia bites too, but my waiter expressed caution of having too much food so I cut that one out. The wine was fine, but I loved the giant glass. I had heard about the dumplings for years, and they were still better than I expected. Smoky, rich, cozy, balanced. That’s a 10/10. I probably looked like a fool licking every last bit of tomato soup out of those awkwardly sized spoons. I know they’re meant to share, but I’d get one order per person. The Brussels were what I expect from a nice restaurant, maybe my one complaint is they were too large so they were hard to tackle in one mouthful. I thought the peppers they came with added little, but the sauce was good. I ate about half the Brussels because I wanted room for dessert - my waiter was right, that’s a lot of food.\n\nFor dessert, the donuts. They are messy and hard to eat but mmmmmmmmmm.\n\nThe bill was $81 before tip. For Vegas, I’m really happy with that. In an out just over an hour. As a solo traveler I’m happy with that too."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhA3NN0fLpLQoy3tVJ57fejf\u0026fid=0x0:0x4a29b9c11c0c00b6""],""When"":""2026-1-9""},{""Name"":""Megan Yem"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVVI_Rw4vquMUpA_ny4I2axvvv2eX2W37T57ruV6LZozMFx-1Vf=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had absolutely wonderful service!

The mac and cheese is a smaller size which was appreciated since there was so much I wanted to try. Add some jalapeños and thank me later.\nBig Bite Breakfast Burrito: scrambled eggs, cheese, bacon, wrapped in a cheese quesadilla with pico de gallo, salsa roja and country potatoes. This wasn’t worth the upgrade. The burrito was just okay and the salsa didn't have any heat to it at all.\nMotley que pulled pork slider : pulled pork smothered in guys bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce, stacked with citrus slaw, pickle chips, aged cheddar cheese plus donkey sauce on a pretzel bun. Now this was good however the sandwich was overshadowed by the fries that came with it. They were absolutely perfect.\nGuys Peanut butter bacon + banana waffle : Belgium waffles, stacked with candied bacon, sliced bananas, creamy peanut butter + bacon maple syrup. I LOVED THIS! This was amazing on so many levels.\nSouthern Style Biscuits and gravy : Buttermilk biscuit, country style gravy topped with bacon crumbles. The gravy had a good flavor and I loved the jalapeños. I wish the biscuit was cut in half and that the gravy was layered to help it absorb more of the gravy.\nNow our server was incredibly friendly and was never far when we needed her.

We had a reservations \u0026 the schedule may have been packed but the restaurant was not due to pending reservation and staff was more than sufficient. We had a reservation and when we were seated we waited 15 minutes for staff to even acknowledge us and bring water. When water arrived we were served in to-go cups, when everyone most around us had glass, are you kidding me a restaurant in Vegas doesn't have enough glasses to serve every table. After waiting 15 minutes for water we waited another 15 minutes to order food (30 minutes into our reservation),  we finally are able to order and its another 48 minutes for our food to arrive ( 1 hour \u0026 18 minutes into our reservation). Now if the food was worth the wait I might get it, but it definitely was not they break up what is an equivalent to a Dennys Grand Slam into 2 plate so its considered 2 order (seems like a tactic to minimize the all you all can eat). We added bottomless Mimosa and we had to track the waitess down every time or it would be pay for bottomless but get 1 drink for the price of bottomless (seemed like another tacticto minimize bottomless drinks).  The final straw was I ordered what I considered my 2nd request (biscuits \u0026 gray) but Guy Fieri's all you can eat restaurant counts as 3rd because they break up french toast (which literally is 1 piece cut into 2 and eggs, 1 sausage, 1 bacon and potatoes into 2 the equivalent to a grand slam)  I waited another 24 minutes and when I finally received my request it was cold! At this point I asked for a manager to advise of my dissatisfaction and the manager did not have the decency to come and hear my concerns to hear what they could do to ensure this doesn’t happen to any other customers. Instead the manager just gave us 25% discount to go away. This was what my wifey and I decided to try for brunch on our anniversary due to all they hype for brunch \u0026 it was a failure. This is my 2nd negative experience at a Guy Fieri restaurant seems to be a pattern overhyped, cheap food, and extremely poor service. We tried to give Guy Fieri's a 2nd chance, after all its Vegas it has to be better right? Two Thumbs down for a 2nd time on Guy Fieri's restaurants the one in Arizona sucks \u0026 the one in Vegas sucks!

Was coming to Vegas for my coed engagement fun weekend and booked a Cabana for Sunday 9/14/2025 for 10 people on Tuesday evening 9/9/2025. By the next morning on 9/10/2025 I was informed of a death in the family and had to cancel. I immediately followed ALL steps to begin a refund of the $325 deposit I had put down on my credit card. I understood I was going to lose $25 of the $325 for the processing fee but nonetheless initiated the refund. Evidently Daylight uses a \""third-party\"" to administer refunds. It gave me a notification that it could potentially take 5-7 BUSINESS DAYS to refund. I gave them the full 7 business days before I reached out inquiring about my refund. The third party administrator confirmed it saw my refund request but could do nothing because the establishment had NOT approved my refund request yet. I was told to reach out to Daylight Beach Club directly to find out why.\n\nHere is where it got interesting...I was able to finally get a hold of someone after calling repeatedly. She claimed to manage these issues; her name was Dawn Fields. She said \""they\"" would be in for meetings later in the week and she would follow up and get right back to me. SHE NEVER DID. Each time was a new excuse and a reason why she would call me back at a later time. Weeks went by and as the frustration grew I finally demanded to know who the hell \""they\"" were and why this simple refund was taking this long. Glad it wasn't thousands of dollars here in limbo. Dawn giggled as if something was funny about me still missing my money the last time I spoke with her claiming she was on top of it and would have the issue resolved for me right away. She never did of course.\n\nUltimately I had to dispute the charge on my credit card (wish I would have just done that from the start) and the credit card company attempted to reach out to the establishment who, surprise surprise, NEVER acknowledged a major credit card company and the money was refunded back to me. Before doing this it had become a second job to follow up as to where my damn refund was at.\n\nComplete and utter aggravation is an understatement. I should have read the reviews in advance because this place is a damn SHAM. I never even got to step foot in this place but this experience alone has ensured that I will never spend a dime here EVER. Daylight Beach Club DO BETTER! The fish rots from the head and it can't be all the people writing reviews of piss poor service who are the issue here."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Michael Wilkinson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW3SExOqa2WLlpSJm0m1ZAz890cI-Crt-aGviAdTEzJ4nMZPyQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""This is a first for me. I have completed nearly 50 reviews. This is the first time I am scoring an establishment a 1. Though it saddens me to do it, unfortunately, it is richly deserved and represents my desire to send a clear message…\n\nBUYER BEWARE\n\nLet's start with the good. The Daylight Beach Club is located at the end of the Las Vegas strip across from the Mandalay Bay Convention Center and offers very easy access. The check-in process was efficient, and the security pat-down provided a sense of safety.\n\nThe pool area is large and spacious, and the DJ had the music blaring and the bass booming. It was a very nice vibe.\n\nUnfortunately, the number of positives can't make up for the level of customer unfriendly policies, pure deception, and direct lying we experienced.\n\nThe day of our event, winds were extremely high, and pools across the city closed due to hazardous conditions. We asked to cancel our reservation. However, they let us know that cancellation was not possible based on their policies, despite the conditions.\n\nFIRST NOTE TO SELF: Be weary of an organization that does NOT permit canceling due to inclement weather.\n\nThey did say they would allow us to change to another day. We were on vacation, had a scheduled itinerary, but opted to rearrange our schedule so as not to lose the money and the experience.\n\nWe had purchased a daybed that was relatively inexpensive ($50) but included a $250 minimum spend. This, of course, is a standard practice, so no problem with that. But here is where the wheels really started coming off the party bus.\n\nWhen we arrived, we got a menu that included $90 pitchers of drinks, $595 for a bottle of Grey Goose, $78 for a bucket of 6 bottled waters ... oh my. Serious sticker shock.\n\nSECOND NOTE TO SELF: In the future, be sure to review menu prices before booking an event with a minimum spend.\n\nSo, instead of pitchers and buckets, we asked to order individual drinks and were told we CAN'T order single drinks or single bottles of water. As we learned later, THIS WAS NOT TRUE.\n\nInstead, they had a policy that individual drinks or single bottles don’t count toward the minimum spend. We were not told this, and we learned it later. BUT WHO MAKES SUCH CUSTOMER UNFRIENDLY POLICIES?\n\nWe were told that the pool was heated. (NOT TRUE)\n\nThere was indeed a DJ, but he was just that: a disc jockey. He simply played the music. No working up the crowd, no encouragement to get out and boogey, nada. Though the crowd was small, nothing was done to get us pumped up. I EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE FROM A SO-CALLED BEACH CLUB.\n\nWhen we closed out our bill, we were told that the check included about a 15% gratuity and an 8% service charge. Our server told us that neither of these go to the servers (NOT TRUE).\n\nThe pool assistant then came over and the server placed two circles on our bill and indicated that the first circle is for a tip for the pool assistant and the second is for a tip for the server, and then they stood there waiting for me to fill in the two circles. UNBELIEVABLE, YES?\n\nOh, but the worst was yet to come.\n\nAt the time of booking, we were told that the event ended at 6:00 PM. At 5:30, the attendants announced that the venue was closed (not that it was closing), that it was closed, and we had to leave, NOW. I asked about the 6:00 PM closing, and they professed no knowledge of it. We shrugged and began to pack up to leave.\n\nI walked toward the bathroom, and the security guard stopped me and said, “THE BATHROOMS ARE CLOSED.”\n\nI explained to the guard that I had just spent over $500 with this establishment, and he was telling me I couldn’t go the bathroom before leaving? He explained that he was just doing his job and that if he allowed me to go to the bathroom, then he would have to let others… blah, blah, blah.\n\nUNBELIEVABLE.\n\nBUYER BEWARE: Daylight Beach Club appears to be FIRST about taking your money, and LAST about delivering a quality customer experience. It is most unfortunate."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgICTmKu0_gE\u0026fid=0x0:0x3af25cd08bddb09b""],""When"":""2024-5-10""},{""Name"":""Kayleigh Valentine"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWTS6SzsYM1VE7rxEYc2xo0_R-9v0VQ-TT0XYo_WCGB-ShPYhc=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""As someone who has worked in the industry for 13+ years, I have never had a worse experience.

We moved to the other end of the pool where we were asked to move our sandals that were basically underneath a bench, out of the way. Once again, out of the pool to move our sandals where security said was a better place. As we made our way back in, we were told no drinks in the pool. As I looked around, there were half a dozen other people in the pool with their drinks, yet no one was saying anything to any of them.

Likely violated fire code.\n\n- You will pay 30-40$ for a well-rum\u0026coke (Bacardi). The prices will vary every time you buy the same drink. When you email concierge for an explanation they will not explain why the drinks were priced different, nor will they present a menu with set prices. Please note that the restaurant-side's \""specialty\"" cocktails are cheaper than this. Green tea shots will also be ~25$ each (Jameson); I ordered 5 for my friends and i and was slapped with a whopping ~140+$ bill!\n\n- Bouncers/line-staff will confuse you with guest list proof / tickets / arm stamps and what is required to enter.

The venue was a lot smaller than anticipated, with minimal pool space. We ended up getting in touch with a promoter who got us free entry and a booth with a bottle. (We were required to tip them a fair amount). We were under the impression that the booth and bottle would be for our group of 6 girls for the bachelorette. Unfortunately we ended up having to share it with another group which we were not told. That was a surprise. We didn’t really get much to drink because there was 10 ppl sharing. It would’ve been nice to know before, as it kind of ruined the vibe of our private bachelorette party. Also if your booth gets sold, you get kicked out and are randomly chilling wherever. Had we known we were sharing we could’ve just bought our own area. The booth was extremely small and no shade/ umbrella was provided. It was cramped with 10 girls. We wouldn’t have lasted more than an hour in that sun with out getting heat stroke. It was not pleasant. We did ask for an umbrella but we were told to make friends if we wanted shade. We ended up meeting a pleasant and respectful group of guys on their bachelor who invited us into their shaded cabana. The rest of the day was a blast once we had some shaded area. We ended up purchasing half the food menu. The chicken tenders were the best I have EVER had. The private cabana with the guys was amazing. They had a private bathroom, a small pool and a large cabana bed. They also had a tv and couch in a shaded room. They actually asked us to join, as they had a minimum spend, and did not think they could consume enough alcohol on their own LOL. The drinks were good, the food was good, and the speakers for the DJ were good. the bottle service women were the most beautiful people I had ever seen. I am sure they hear it all the time, but I complimented one of them and they didn’t even smile. They were not the friendliest but I can imagine it gets annoying. We ended up having an absolute blast and I recommend going. If you have a group, I suggest you splurge and get a nice shaded booth… or “make friends” if you want a great experience.

We had a mini fridge with waters and sodas that were included. Towels and floats for the lazy river were already there and are included. We had 3 lounge chairs with umbrellas and obviously the cabana with some chairs, a table, a couch, a ceiling fan and a television. It was luxury at its best, especially in the heat. We were able to charge drinks and food to our room and never had a problem finding Matt or Liz. They took great care of us and were very nice. Jacques was the man!  He got things setup in our cabana by laying our towels, making sure our umbrella was positioned to give us optimal shade, and was so nice. The next day, we had a day bed and once again, Jacques was on it. He put towels on our bed and made sure we were comfortable and all while being in the best mood. Overall, the pool at MB is awesome but your experience will be enhanced if you have a cabana or daybed with shade."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgICrstqs3wE\u0026fid=0x0:0xb266dc10d1642bc3""],""When"":""2024-7-5""},{""Name"":""McKenzie"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVY1AOcEW5CrSvE629li1Sw9B57xxM4ZxekxHmQwvL7SVg9Pbw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Very enjoyable time with lots to do! Plenty of free lounge chairs to sit in. Towels are at front of entrance. There is a lazy river, wave pool, kiddie pool, pool, and spa. All was very fun to get in. Only complaint was the water was freezing But somewhat refreshing at the hottest point of the day. And the other thing was the fact that in the lazy river tubes are not complementary you have to go buy them at the store which is fine but they were $30 per tube. Speaking of the store the prices were a tad high but plenty of inventory and the staff were friendly. They have lots of life guards with lots of rules then again it makes since as you never know what will happen. The beach bar is nice to eat at whether you order and go lounge or sit down.

On a weekend and busy day, make sure to get in before 1030-11 to get a seat.  We usually got in between 8-9 and had no issues finding a prime location, but many people spent 30 minutes or More trying to find a spot around the resort.  The best spots, in my opinion, are by the waterfall in the lazy river. You can even move a chair under the cave and lay there the whole day.  Make sure to find something in the shade and/or put on a lot of sunscreen. It’s hot!\n\nAlso, bring your own tube from home for the lazy river. They will blow them up for you for free at the shop! To rent a tube is very expensive or you have to rent a cabana for a day (they come with a select number of tubes).

No wind, no storms, nothing.\nWhat makes it worse is that other larger tables were allowed to have their umbrellas open, which made me feel completely discriminated against. It’s beyond unfair to force guests to sit under the scorching sun with no shade, especially when you’re literally charging them for the umbrella they’re not allowed to use.\nIt’s such a shame for a place with potential to treat paying guests this way.

With no major DJ playing, the lineups were minimal, and since we had a table, we skipped right through. The $500 minimum spend for the table felt fair for Vegas standards. Service was excellent — our server, Maddison, was pleasant, attentive, and professional. This is clearly a well-run establishment from a business standpoint. The staff — especially the women promoting the party atmosphere — are well-trained and know how to keep the energy up while encouraging guests to spend.\n\nSecurity presence was solid, which adds to the sense of safety. This doesn’t feel like the kind of place where anyone would get away with starting trouble. The crowd was overall well-behaved and the vibe was energetic but classy.\n\nMusic? 5 stars. Atmosphere? 5 stars. Cleanliness of the bathrooms? Also 5 stars. The venue itself is fantastic.\n\nHowever, where LIV Beach loses stars — and ultimately my trust — is with the alcohol. It’s obvious the hard liquor is watered down. One will notice immediately when you taste the liquor clean. The bottles aren’t brought out in original sealed bottles are immediately poured into plastic jugs for serving. That’s a big red flag. For a place that charges what seems like an 800% markup on alcohol, there’s absolutely no justification for compromising integrity just to stretch profits further.\n\nI've attended at world-class beach clubs like Nikki Beach, Shimmy Beach Club, the Grand and the W in Thailand, and none of them cut corners like this. When you're paying top dollar, you expect quality and transparency — not shortcuts.\n\nBecause of this, I believe the 3-star average rating LIV currently holds is accurate, and I’m giving it 3 stars as well. Great venue, great vibe — but a fundamental breach of trust when it comes to what’s in your glass."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgMCYmrT16gE\u0026fid=0x0:0x4a08a6e0adcd01fb""],""When"":""2025-5-3""},{""Name"":""Deisy Vega"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVqPHaAQA8j2yb5Jdf31AKn-r8FluE9EgS6IdVI7cIHJar_kZ9qkg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great day club, great music, good DJs!

He had requested that we be added to the invited guest list for free entry through the app DiscoTech. He was additionally told by the concierge at the hotel that we should receive free priority entry. We joined the invited guest line and were given no instruction. We stood there for several minutes before someone came around to check our IDs and give us stamps. Several more minutes passed, and we were moved over to a different part of the line closer to the security check point. Someone came around and checked IDs against the guest list, and my friend presented his ID. We were given a ticket and told that we would need to pay $50 for male entry. My friend inquired why this was the case, as this was contrary to the communication he had received through DiscoTech when he made the reservation and the information provided by the hotel concierge. We were simply told that things were subject to change. Again, no additional instructions were given, and we were led to believe that we should receive entry to the club. We stood in the line for nearly two hours, corralled like cattle. At this point, we were both experiencing dehydration and desperately needed to use a bathroom. I understand that the pre-purchased tickets were given priority, but at this point there was no one in the pre-purchased ticket line, and the security attendants were just standing around twiddling their thumbs. I finally went to one of the staff members to ask about an update on when we might be allowed entry, and I expressed that this was a long time for people to be expected to wait without access to water or a bathroom. She said that she didn’t know, and that if we wanted to avoid the line we would have to pay $100 per person for the cover. I finally relented just to escape what felt like psychological torture. We’ve been to other pool clubs on the strip using the guest list and have never experienced this kind of treatment. When we finally got in, the pool was so crowded, I can only imagine it was oversold. I was crawling over people all day in the heat. Disco Lines was great but not worth being extorted for $200."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""M Mariotti"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVgU3SlEr3H9gDkAG3pNgY299K01PSw0ZAXI9a8nEsJvWDj-9g=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I attended liv beach club on Saturday June 28th to see Dom dolla. We arrived at 11:20 thinking dom would start at 11:30 from the drop off area we walked into the fountain Blau and walked until we found and escalator and took it to the 3rd floor. We followed some signs which brought us to a waiting area for the guest list which had a $75 cover and an express lane for people who bought tickets for $90. I would highly recommend buying a ticket rather than doing the guest list. We then went through security which consisted of pat downs and wallet checks. We then went inside and quickly realized we had no place to put our stuff and Dom wasn’t actually going to be coming on till 3. This actually worked out in our favor seeing that drinks were $60 for a 24 oz and $100 for a pitcher we decided to get a day bed for a $1000 tab. So the deal was spend $1000 on drinks and food and you also get the day bed. We bought a bottle of tequila and got some waters. There were 2 openers before Dom dolla and they were both great. The second opener was the highlight of the day though. We had finished our bottle about halfway through the second set and figured we would eat too. So we upgraded our day bed to a couch and it put us on the ground level facing the stage a great upgrade compared to our last spot. The staff was excellent during this process helping us move our stuff and getting our tabs switched over. We also got a safe with this new setup and the people next to us were also awesome. So having the safe and the people next to us we were able to leave our area unattended if we wanted and go to the pool or the pit. Also to be stated is how perfectly spaced everything is to where if you want to be in a crowd you can but also there are places to get space. With about 30 minutes left we closed out the tab everything was reasonable based on where we were and how do the staff is there’s a 15% gratuity and a service charge. These were acceptable because they aren’t just wait staff they are the best in the city they also mix drinks as well. One charge to watch out for is waters we bought 31 waters and it came out to $434. You can walk up to the bar and ask for a cup of water and they will give it to you free. This is an expensive but well worth experience and I have already started planning my return in October."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhBtbWAi83zAgrW-JjyBPzSh\u0026fid=0x0:0x4a08a6e0adcd01fb""],""When"":""2025-7-4""}]",null,,5

To get to the pool from the garage or parking area is very uninviting because it’s also mixed with the employees entrance and looks as if it’s under construction or unfinished. Once we got to the entrance, the security was nice and informed us that there wasn’t any lockers for our stuff (brought a pool/beach bag with a change of clothes) and that we could check it in at the hotel’s bell desk. I didn’t want the hassle of carrying our stuff around since it was a pool party. It would have been nice to keep our stuff safe nearby and find it strange as to why they don’t provide lockers. It’s inconvenient to walk all the way back to the front lobby of the casino to leave our stuff there but at least I was happy they had an option. We got on the guest list the night prior so it was a smooth entry. The pool was decent and they layout was good. The drinks at the bar where overpriced. The first bartender I got was very friendly and the second one was rude. We had already bought 4 of the 32oz for $40 bucks each. Cups where filled up with mostly ice and they weren’t even strong so I asked if they had other strong cocktails. The bartender replied “they are all the same”. Would have been nice to suggest something better to drink that’s all. Overall it was ok.

The feeling was mutual with my husband, we felt the venue was not for us , and for younger crowds\n\nWe were planning a bachelor/bachelorette party in August for our daughter and future son in law , and felt Marquee would be something they would both enjoy .\n\nDuring a visit in June  I met Jake Talley , a senior host at Marquee. He assisted with bookings for my daughter’s group on one day(Friday ) , and my son in laws on another (Monday ). He was extremely helpful during the planning  . I felt kind of bad contacting him so much due to the many questions/concerns I had . Jake answered everything in a timely manner, and gave me all the information needed to make our visit memorable\n\nNeedless to say our visit was a massive success . Both parties had an amazing time . Our guests thanked us multiple times with how much they enjoyed the food , music , and overall  atmosphere .\n\nVisiting Marquee on 2 different days , Friday and Monday, I got a look at how the venue runs during extremely busy and very chill settings.\n\nThe staff worked just as hard on both days and were very pleasant to my guests.  The food was phenomenal and not what I expected for “pool food”. Be warned the food can be on pricier side but at the same time the portions are massive and plentiful!  Especially the taco platter and some of the other foods that we tried and worth the mention. The chicken satay, nachos and wings!\n\nWe would like to specifically acknowledge our server Zelmara on the guys visit on Monday . She gave many recommendations, visited our party often , and was very sweet .  She was from Chicago like us , and had some nice conversations about it .\n\nI also would like to compliment the server  assigned to my daughter’s party on Friday .  I was there on Friday for a short time . I chose to leave to let my daughter and her guests have their space .\nOur daughter said the server was very kind and hustled to make sure  they had what they needed.  The buss/support staff was also hustling and we appreciated that. They would make they were constantly changing out our ice buckets so our drinks wouldn’t get warm in that hot Vegas summer weather!\n\nMost of all a big thanks to Jake Talley .  It wouldn’t have been as seamless without him .\n\nA few tips if you never been to Marquee.\n\nLook up the dress code before you attend. The pricing and crowd level can be significantly different on weekends and when there is a guest DJ. If you want a more relaxed atmosphere with less crowd , give a weekday a try .\nWe understand the venue is being remodeled and updated, we can not wait to see the updates and looking forward to returning!\nWe were overall very pleased with our decision to choose Marquee day club as  part of our trip!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAEhH9WZeouPrBpjbULGuRx\u0026fid=0x0:0xd2979bf3140876cf""],""When"":""2025-10-25""},{""Name"":""Nate Neel"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIAjq9arfZsixzHzNBnckDVX85LrTBiqf8z4jChbGWZbkXA6Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Wooow, what an amazing experience.

I was trying to research beforehand to see the best way to “do it”. I bought general admission tickets for a girls trip to see the kygo set on July 5th. I was disappointed when I got there to see they were also handing out free GA tickets to anyone in the casino that was just walking around. So wasted a little bit of money there but it wasn’t much. Entering at noon was easy and the pool wasn’t busy. We were easily able to get a drink at the bar and get a towel from security. You have to get there early if you are GA to get a spot at the poolside as there is NOWHERE for ga to sit. So you’re either in the pool or sitting on the edge (if you’re lucky). If I were to do it again I would have paid the $500 for a beach chair. The music quality was good, there is a very small dancing space in front of the dj booth which could be bigger. I think they need more personal item storage options as the whole edge of the pool is people’s purses, clothing, shoes, phones etc. it looks sloppy and nothing is secure. They do have lockers but they’re first come first serve. If you go, bring your phone, credit card in a waterproof bag and leave the rest behind. Mixed drinks were $68 and beers were $16, bartenders were not friendly and were in no rush to serve you. At 2pm the line to get a drink took over 20 minutes to get a single beer. They need a better, more mobile checkout option. The credit card readers are stationary and seemed to be slowing down the already slow bar tenders. We ended the afternoon in a cabana which was nice. If you have the disposable income, def go that route just so you have a better view and smaller shared pool. I would return for another concert but do it differently."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDZMa707GsBJBSWHpw6oWaL\u0026fid=0x0:0x3f7f7cccc5909f0""],""When"":""2025-7-7""},{""Name"":""Carolyn McCabe-Joy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVqPTlZihuRjQ1vP6ZKLEDaVObfHDq7HByWw0zT8-L6c2eUeoRNOg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It was so fun!!

The view from up there is pretty good as well.\n\nThe biggest issue was getting through the door. The cover charge is $30 a person. However, if you walk out onto the strip you can easily get passes to get you in for a much cheaper rate. After about 30 seconds of walking I was able to get $20 coupon for myself, with another one for ladies to get in free. This brought the cover charge down to just $20 for 2. After we got our IDs checked by the first bouncer, we then got to the cover charge counter and paid our $20 fee. Then, we got to the third bouncer who wouldn't allow us in because we had a bag with us. They did not seem to have anything coordinated between themselves, and the 3rd bouncer said the cover charge counter could hold a bag for us, but they refused. They definitely need to get their stuff together, because if I had paid $60 just to find out I can't get through the door there would have been a serious problem. I hope the owner of the establishment reads this review, because the bouncing staff is very inefficient. There will be issues if this ever happens again.\n\nAfter finally stowing our bags back at our hotel, we were able to get into the club. The people shuttling us through the elevators were very polite.\n\nDrinks were very, very expensive. But I suspect this is typical for all clubs on the strip.\n\nTL;DR: find discounted entry cards on the strip.

The club was clean and the people there were awesome. From the guy at the door, the lady charging my cover charge, the guys behind the bar and the  dancers were super cool and friendly.\n\nAs an average middle class working stiff don’t come here with $400-$500 and think this will go far (not meant in a solicitation way). Now with that being said I don’t know if the costs that I am going to list out are industry standard but I have been to other places in the past yearmand it wasn’t this expensive. The foot traffic has definitely decreased coming from pretty much everyone I spoke to who works/lives here so I get it when everyone is clawing for dollars.\n\nOne Uber driver said LVSC is like going to a local burger joint and paying high end steakhouse prices. However, I have learned that these drivers are affiliated with these clubs so they have a vested interest to promote or steer to you certain clubs… it truly felt that way.\n\nIf you Uber the cover is $50. They offer pick up service for free cover but not sure what you have to pay for as a package so that might be better off. I got Coors Light which was $12. The dancers are are nice but VERY persistent immediately going for privet dances. They start off at $200 for 15 min and like every place it goes up from there. But it was all the extra surcharges that were listed off. You have to pay to rent the room or space and some rooms you have to pay for a bottle and depending on what bottle you want there is another additional charge. It seemed the extra charges kept to get going and going.\n\nIt wasn’t until I declined the private dances (multiple times) they offered me a dance for one song $40. Be careful…. I didn’t get the feeling the dancer I had was going to tell me when the song is over. And again I get it everyone is trying to get their bag but Vegas as a hole is pricing out the middle class. Anyways do with that what you will. I am sure I will get called cheap or broke with the tag “tell me you don’t have money without telling me you don’t have money”.

They treat you like you don’t belong there. You can’t sit or stand anywhere without someone shining a flashlight in your face and telling you to move. And dancing on the huge dance floor is impossible because they escort you out.\nThere was one security guard in particular — a big Black man — who made everything worse. His attitude was aggressive and intimidating. Wherever I moved, he showed up to yell or push people around. It got to the point where I felt uncomfortable even existing in the space.\nThey pack the place with too many people and then yell at everyone because there’s no room to move. My friends and I stayed only for the DJ, but we couldn’t dance or enjoy anything because staff kept bothering us.\nWe were so frustrated that we didn’t spend a single dollar on drinks. They don’t deserve anyone’s money with that attitude.\nThe music and lights were great, but the horrible treatment ruined the night.

We were on the guest list, and even though we arrived around 12:45 AM, there was no line, so we got in quickly. However, the line setup was a bit confusing, so more signage would have been helpful.\n\nAs many have said, the entrance to LIV is stunning--definitely a great photo op spot. I also liked the long hallway between the entrance and the main club space, which works as a perfect break area. The club's layout is well-designed, offering a view of the stage from almost any spot. With multiple bars and plenty of places to stand outside the main dance floor, it's perfect for introverted people like us.\n\nThe sound level was good, and the music was enjoyable. My husband liked his cocktail, and the club wasn't overcrowded compared to places like Hakkasan. The security team was firm but polite (not aggressive or on a power trip), which was a nice change. The only downside was that, despite LIV's supposed zero-tolerance policy, there were people smoking cigarettes inside, which really bothered our noses.\n\nI'd definitely come back to LIV for the right artist.

I don’t normally leave reviews but the experience here was ridiculous. Was here to see john summit and for my mental sake had to leave before he even came out. They fill the club past what seems a hazardous capacity. The dance floor is small considering the amount of people they bring in and how huge the headliners are.\n\nOnce the dance floor you cannot even move in is at capacity, you are forced to be on the sides and outskirts with no view of the stage and people pushing you left and right.\n\nOn top of being herded like sheep, the security guards are extremely rude and were pushing and pulling people forcefully. The arrogance and lack of proper training of the security guards was the cherry on top to this horrible experience. What makes this worse is these problems are solvable. If they were to limit capacity in a way that made sense this would not happen. The sheer ratio of one star  reviews already when they have only been open for a year speaks for itself.\n\nLuckily I was able to get on the guest list and expedite the line by paying $50, but waiting in the guest list line is not worth it, there is people that easily waited 3+ hours and then got told they had that to pay the full price half way through. I would have been sick if I paid the $300 admission for something like this, please save your money and see your favorite artist somewhere else.

We weren’t entirely sure what to expect going in, but the entire experience was outstanding from start to finish. If you enjoy seafood, bold flavours, and trying new dishes, this spot should definitely be on your list when in Vegas.\n\nEven though it was a packed evening with every table full, the service remained prompt, friendly, and very professional. You could tell the team was busy, but any questions we had were answered quickly and with helpful recommendations. Our wine glasses were never empty, and the pacing of the meal was perfect.\n\nWe sampled a variety of dishes—beef ribs, steak, dumplings, sea bass, lobster, shrimp—and every single one was prepared and presented in a unique and memorable way. The flavours were layered, thoughtful, and beautifully balanced. Dessert was another experience in itself: we tried three different desserts, each one a creative twist on familiar classics. The sweet caviar dessert in particular was truly one of the most unique and delicious desserts I’ve ever had.\n\nCost-wise, this isn’t a budget dining spot—expect to spend some money—but the experience, flavours, and service make it well worth it.\n\nHighly recommend. 5 stars."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Miguel Sanchez (Mich)"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWTmHPGhSqc202QqXYjblsu9y94PdorVEEfFvKbXHmu39F7sH4=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""As one of the world's premier nightlife destinations, Hakkasan exceeded my expectations in every way.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped into the club, we were blown away by the sheer scale and opulence of the venue.

We were lucky enough to catch a set by one of the world's top DJs, and the energy in the room was electric.

absolute must-visit in Las Vegas. From the moment you walk in, the ambiance sets the tone—dimly lit, stylish, and energetic without feeling overwhelming. The space feels upscale and immersive, with a cool, modern Asian aesthetic that makes the whole experience feel like a night out, not just dinner.\n\nThe food is phenomenal across the board. Every dish we tried was beautifully presented and packed with bold, balanced flavors. The sushi was incredibly fresh, the dim sum was delicate and flavorful, and the hot dishes were rich without being heavy. You can really tell that a lot of care goes into both the ingredients and the execution. Portions are generous for a high-end restaurant, making it great for sharing and sampling multiple items.\n\nWhat truly elevates Tao, though, is the staff. The service was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely warm. Our server took the time to explain the menu, offered great recommendations, and checked in at just the right moments without being intrusive. Everything felt smooth and well-coordinated, even with how busy the restaurant was.\n\nOverall, Tao Asian Bistro delivers on every level—exceptional food, top-notch service, and an unforgettable atmosphere. Whether you’re celebrating something special or just want an incredible dining experience in Vegas, Tao is absolutely worth it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhBBZkDIxlxYILYVpriuqsRQ\u0026fid=0x0:0x86765d15e7373310""],""When"":""2026-1-3""},{""Name"":""DANA PALACIOS"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVnd5_YFOHXuY3mhYCS8vtM6fKoNH1I09olmEMg-sgobM5QyUq2mw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had such an amazing experience at this restaurant, and a big part of that was because of our servers, Brandon and Justin.

By the time we left at 1:30am (we stood there for 4 hours) he still hadn’t even started singing.\n\nWhat ultimately pushed us to leave wasn’t even the delay - it was how unsafe and unmanaged the crowd felt. Two extremely intoxicated women repeatedly pushed and danced their way through the crowd, flailing, touching people, invading personal space (inappropriately dancing against whoever was in their way), and even spilling a drink on me. Their main goal was to get as close as they could and they weren’t letting anything stand in their way. Many other attendees were visibly frustrated, yet no staff or security stepped in. It was uncomfortable, chaotic, and honestly upsetting.\n\nOn top of that, visibility was terrible. The stage was packed with so many people that even standing near the front, we weren’t able to see the artist.

Put a $500 deposit down on 2 tables at the Chateau 8 months before the date of arrival. Contacted the company the day before the date I had reserved 8 months ago. Come to find out the reservation had not been booked. The way I found out was contacting the Chateau Night Club. All bottle Service Vegas did was give me the run around. Bottle Service Vegas ended up booking a reservation last minute. When my party showed up at the Chateau we were told the club promoter needed to be there with us to get in under the reservation. So the $500 I put down 8 months ago was useless. The Chateau ended up being awesome about everything and help us to get two great tables and have a good time. This company is a joke! For what bottle  service Vegas charged on the invoice  I had for 2 tables and bottle service was marked up $700 more than if I went through the Chateau directly. So I got scammed out of $500 dollars. The club said it is honestly not a good idea to go through 3rd parties. Learned my lesson don't buy a Rolex off the street! This company is grabage.

I was told I had to pay a cover charge of like 30-40 dollars? I honestly can't remember. I did that and walked in.\nInside the club there was a bar where some dancers were sitting and a nice stage where one was performing for the crowd. I would say that the women were all attractive, but not in a fake sort of way. I sat for a bit near the stage and was approached by several women. I was kind of reluctant to do a private dance at first but eventually gave in, and I do not regret it one bit! The dancer was a beautiful brunette with a very sweet personality. I very much enjoyed my short time with her.\nI would also add that NONE of the other dancers who came to me were pushy or felt scammy in any way.

for those that have tables really.\n\nThe Pinky Room is a jazz/live band club located in the heart of the Bellagio - closer to the exit towards the Caesar's Palace walkway.\n\nWe waited in line on a Saturday evening right when this opened. We were told that this was the second anniversary of the Pink Room, so it was reportedly abnormally busy with us having to wait about an hour and 10 minutes before getting in. There was no cover charge, but there is a bouncer checking over your outfit. We weren't told exactly what wasn't allowed but supposedly they will check (saw a lot of the bouncers looking at shoes in particular).\n\nOnce you are in, you got a stamp in case you need to step out to grab food or go to the restroom which is not in the club. The bar is set to the far side of the club with the bar area and dance floor set for general attendees. Most of the area though is for reserved tables that require higher drink minimums. The bar at the beginning of the night was easy to get to but once the band came on, it was a tough battle getting a drink as a regular attendee since most of the patrons were really squished in that area trying to watch the band.\n\nThe band itself that we saw was great with reportedly Bruno's brother on the drums. It was a fun time and the acoustics were pretty good. The mocktail I had also wasn't bad with drink prices being normal Vegas Strip pricing.\n\nHappy to see more live music venues pop up on the Strip. It's just rough if you don't have the table."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Leila Gross"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWSnuPi31-yLCLuPbPpB6O9MCNEI88Zo64OZNPNw9hB5r7t0YYlpw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This venue is located inside the Bellagio Hotel and Casino on the main floor.

On this particular night, I was even lucky enough to hear a little bit of Bruno Mars, which made the evening unforgettable. I also really appreciate the no-phones policy — it creates a more authentic, intimate vibe and allows you to fully enjoy the moment.\n\nThat said, the entrance experience does not match what’s inside.

He told me that if you pull out your cellphone, the staff will escort you out immediately. When I arrived near the entrance, I saw a sign that read, \""No cell phones. What happens at the Pinky Ring stays at the Pinky Ring,\"" seemingly reinforcing their strict cellphone policy.\n\nI waited in line for approximately 30 minutes, and the lounge has no cover. Once inside, I felt transported to an upscale speakeasy. It's a mid-size venue with a central dance floor, seated sections around the perimeter, a bar along the far wall, and a stage where the live band performs! On this night, the Hooligans performed! The stage has a closed curtain, and every 25 minutes, the curtain opens, and the band performs live, which is when it's \""turn up time!\"" The band played classic rap and R\u0026B live, and they killed it!\n\nThe charismatic lead singer, Kameron Whalum, can sing and showed off his falsetto while singing \"" Frontin\"" by Pharrell and Jay-Z, and he sang it better than Pharrell. There were moments when Kameron came into the crowd and danced with female audience members! My favorite moment occurred when they performed \"" Still Not a Player\"" by one of my favorite rappers of all time, Big Pun!\n\nThe Pinky Ring is a vibe, and I can't think of any other lounge or nightclub that's like it! I planned to pregame at the Pinky Ring and go to a nightclub afterward. However, I aborted my pregame plan once I saw how festive the atmosphere was!\n\nThe lounge has no restrooms, so you have to use a restroom in the casino.\n\nWhile inside, I spoke to a Caucasian woman with her cellphone out, and I thought she was living on the edge, risking getting thrown out for the lounge's strict no-cellphone policy. Before seeing her pull out her cellphone I thought I would have to go old school and start bringing paper and a pen to the lounge to write down phone numbers if I met any attractive women there in the future. I asked a bouncer about the cellphone policy, and he told me you can use your cellphone, but you can't take pictures or videos.\n\nA pleasant sound engineer named Ross gave me the rundown of the lounge: he said they rotate five different bands that have all worked with Bruno Mars, and on some nights, Bruno Mars will pop up to perform. Bruno Mars is the owner, and the lounge is his baby, so go on the right night and get a special treat with Bruno Mars performing live. On the night I went, the crowd was diverse but 90% Caucasian. I highly recommend the Pinky Ring as a date spot where you can B.Y.O.M. (Bring Your Own Melanin), dance the night away, and make it a memorable, festive night! The Pinky Ring is a strong five stars!

bar with sky-high views that will literally take your breath away, this place should be at the top of your list. The panoramic skyline is unreal—like stepping into a postcard. Sunset here? Absolutely magical. The space is sleek, the ambiance is classy without trying too hard, and every photo looks like it belongs on a travel magazine cover.\n\nBut here’s the part I can’t wrap my head around: it’s… kind of dead.\n\nFor a place with views this insane, you’d expect it to be packed every night. Instead, it feels like I stumbled onto a well-kept secret—or a secret that’s too well-kept. There were only a handful of people scattered around, which made the vibe a little flat. Not bad, just oddly quiet for a bar that should be buzzing.\n\nOn the plus side, no crowds means fast service, plenty of space, and uninterrupted views. On the downside, if you’re looking for energy or a social scene, you might be left wondering where everyone else went.\n\nStill, I’m rooting for this spot. The potential is sky high—literally. If they can bring in some life to match the view, it could be one of the best bars in the city."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhBd3ybEj6irlXKDslOihlZL\u0026fid=0x0:0x7b319f2cd8dc421e""],""When"":""2025-11-14""},{""Name"":""Krystiana Nelson"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVFGjgvyladj3UMyYcHEklDhxPKGoaFAfdHhWqAHnbTKCycRWr29A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing cocktails crafted with precision and care.

Neither of us have ever been to a strip club. We got picked up at the hotel and tipped the driver. No charge for the ride, it was apart of the weekday special I bought ahead of time. The special was to include a ride to the club, a bottle of casa Migos tequila or a bottle of grey goose vodka, unlimited carafes of mixers you wanted (juice or soda is what the ad says), no cover, VIP entry, and table on the main floor. We were picked up by a very polite driver and taken to the club. We were taken straight to VIP entry and let in with no cover as promised. Once inside we were taken to our table on the main floor. Here is were things started to not add up. 2 girls sat down with us IMMEDIATELY, I didn't even have my coat off yet. No issues here, they were very chill and not pushy at all. One girl was offering lap dances 3 songs for $100 which I thought was reasonable but she was taken by another couple before we could go through with it. Another girl joined us instead, she was also lovely. Our \""server\"" came to our table and asked us if we wanted tequila or vodka. I said vodka and she tells me that it's a bottle of STOLI. I have a screenshot of the package I bought that specifically says grey goose. I didn't say anything and moved on. She then asks what mixers we want and before I can respond she says our options are cranberry, pineapple, and sold water..... The package said any juices or soda but we were told no. After a short time she brings the bottle, mixers, glasses and ice. At no point did she ever come back. There was also no water offered for the table. I had my husband go to the bar to get me a bottle of water and it was $12. No surprising for Vegas I guess but you would think water would be included with a table. We ended up going to the back with a girl for $200 for 15 minutes, she was lovely and so much fun but the server back there (we were REQUIRED to buy a drink in the back there) was awful. Very rude. Security also interrupted our time back there. ATM fees are about $36 for $200. Bring your own cash for sure. Some of the reviews say you have to get bunny money but we did not have to. Girls on stage were pretty entertaining but nothing too crazy.

It was my FAVORITE place to go on Saturday nights in the early 2000s. An up-and-coming Jimmy Hopper held sway. The music stopped so everyone could watch the Bellagio Fountains from the balcony.\nThen Hyde replaced the Fontana Room in 2011. It became the swanky spot for dancin' and romancin', winning award after award.\nIn 2019 the Bellagio decide to open the Mayfair Supper Club in this space.\nThe club had such a following the owners simply moved it to the top floor of T-Mobile Arena. Now, instead of live music and DJs, the action on the arena floor provides the entertainment.\nIt's like having your own private suite at the arena but with all the trappings of a stereotypical Las Vegas lounge. It's a marriage that works.\nYou queue up on the far side of T-Mobile Arena and go through the scanner outside. The elevator to Hyde is right there and up you go!\nThe elevator has a closed-circuit TV monitor so you can watch the arena action if you are late.\nOnce inside the club, find a table. I like the ones right up against the railing because their view is the best.\nThere are also cozy nooks for a more intimate lounge experience.\nHyde has an extensive  liquor and wine menu. Prices are, well, Las Vegas club-like.\nThe club also has a large food menu. The food offerings barely fit on the plate. It's bar food, natch.\nThere are TVs everywhere to watch what's going on on the arena floor. But the sound is muffled this high up if you want to hear the play-by-play.\nAnd if you are afraid of heights, this place is NOT for you!\nI was there for the Professional Bull Riders Saturday night performance. Having had season tickets when they rode bulls at Thomas \u0026 Mack, I can tell you this was an elegant experience by comparison.\nOK, I loved the Fontana Room.

Whether you're a first-timer or a frequent visitor, the Strip always offers something new.\n\nThe Bellagio Fountain Show is absolutely iconic. The water performances are perfectly timed to music and lights, and it's a must-see experience that runs every 15–30 minutes in the evenings.\n\nParis Las Vegas is another highlight. The Eiffel Tower replica and Parisian-style architecture make for great photo spots, and the observation deck offers stunning views of the Strip, especially at night.\n\nOne food spot I highly recommend is Mediterranean Shawarma near the Strip. The food was fresh, flavorful, and filling — a hidden gem that really stood out on this trip.\n\nA word of caution: stay away from people approaching you on the street offering \""free\"" tickets, club passes, or other deals. Many are pushy and some are outright scams. A simple \""no thanks\"" and walking away works best.\n\nA few quick tips: wear comfortable shoes, stay hydrated, and make sure to see the Strip at night — the lights and atmosphere are something you won’t find anywhere else.\n\nThe Las Vegas Strip blends entertainment, food, and nonstop energy into one unforgettable experience.

The Eiffel Tower deck tour at night provided a breathtaking panoramic view of the city. Our stay at the Paris hotel was pleasant, although the room's appearance didn't quite match the online descriptions. Some upgrades and window cleaning would certainly enhance the experience. While the Eiffel Tower view from our room was fantastic, the dirty windows slightly detracted from the beauty. We also learned a valuable lesson regarding in-room amenities: even seemingly complimentary items like warm water and a couple of candy packages resulted in an unexpected $80 charge, as there was no price list or indication of a fee. We were accustomed to a mini-bar being in the refrigerator, but we didn't have one. Consequently, we now know to avoid touching anything unless we're prepared to pay for it.

One of the female dancers sat with us and we got to talking, she made us feel so welcomed and at ease and we even got a dance from her which was also insanely talented and fun! I can’t remember any names as I was very, very intoxicated but everyone was amazing. The men were something else each one sexy, sweet and knew what they were doing. I wish I could remember their names to give them the credit they deserve but one (my favorite) was wearing red shorts and another in black shorts. One had shoulder length black hair as well. The hostess there was one of the sweetest women I have ever met. I highly, HIGHLY recommend going here rather than any other place you can find, you won’t find one as incredible as this place!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Elizabeth Shilling"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL38iOteenOyUkWhYQD1bpNXz0q_gqJT8AzfiD7YVTY-3-__A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""If I could give 10 stars, I absolutely would!

Total VIP treatment! We ended up staying until 3 a.m. and we're soaking the whole time 😉\nThe dancers are very friendly and definitely know how to make sure you’re having a great time. Lap dances are $40, private rooms are $100 for three songs, and trust me—it’s worth every dollar. I would bring cash ahead of time! The ATM inside charged $40 just to pull out $200 (the more you pull out, the more they charge).

Before anyone thinks I have issues I would invite you to read the review I wrote for Magic Mike as one therefore will see that I don't create issues such as what happened which I relate to you here. As a gay man in his late 60s I am clearly unattractive. I have cancer. My hair is falling out from treatment. I look awful. I had surgery where I have a huge scar across my head and have a rather large scar on my arm from a tumor being removed and a very botched   skin graft. Clearly unattractive. Still lovable at least in the eyes of God and those who don't discriminate. I had a ticket for tonight show but I did not attend because I don't feel welcome. I would not say that to be true of the whole cast as I have not met them but overall I could not bring myself to attend. While at the box office at the link I saw Alejandro who I recognized from a video I saw when I was reading reviews. I walked over to him and told him I recognized him and he looked completely taken aback by my presence. He did not speak to me nor acknowledge me but was delighted to see the women walk by who he put beads around their necks. I didn't want beads but I would have liked a simple recognition. The following day I was downtown at the Fremont Street experience and there he was again along with a drop dead gorgeous dancer. The other dancer invited me to come over to have my picture taken with them. Alejandro was dismayed. He went to the motions and when it was over with the other dancer asked me to speak to some manager about how to obtain copies of the pictures which I knew damn well I'm looking to give you 5 cents because upon the completion of the photo snapshots Alejandro said okay bye get out of here. I said I'm going to the show Saturday night and he said well I'm not in it. The manager wanted 45 dollars telling me that it was a special buy one picture get one for free. I don't understand free in the context of me spending $45. Through the discrimination that I believe is ageism not homophobia and also the site of an ugly man along with the manipulation of the pricing I did not attend the show tonight. I will cut my $70 loss and I will accept it with the hope that this review will cause gay men and others to pause and consider with great discretion if this is the appropriate selection for you for entertainment value. I have never been to Vegas. This is my bucket list I'm probably the last vacation I will ever have. Thanks for nothing. And thank you Magic Mike for everything. It is in the best interest of chippendales not to give me a formulated response telling me that we live hoping to give complete guest satisfaction and we will take what you have said here and escalate this situation and we hope to have you come back and give us another try. Do not tell me that feedback like mine is important for you to make improvements. That would be shallow and would lack sincerity indicating lack of sufficient thoughts for an appropriate response. I sincerely wish the cast and crew a great advancement in your lives. Unfortunately I won't be able to experience or meet the great people with this fantastic organization.  And that is my choice and not the fault of chippendales but the decision stems from the behavior of some of its representatives."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",null,,8

sure about this one but a friend of a friend recommended it and it was almost perfect. It was definitely more modern Mexican which apparently I am into. I thought it had a very cool setting very relaxing kind of day of the dead type theme going which was different for sure but cool all the same. The chips, salsa and guacamole were wonderful little kick off the salsa had a perfect amount of heat and that guacamole was just so creamy so flavorful one of the best I’ve ever had. For appetizers we started out with the charred octopus, which was so unbelievably tender. You didn’t even need a knife to cut it yet the ends of the tentacles were perfectly crisp. The chorizo and potatoes underneath added an unbelievable flavor and I’m not sure what the side sauces were but they were the complete composed bite. We also got the chicken empanadas which were extremely crispy well seasoned And had an amazing chipotle, mayo, dipping sauce it was just the right amount of heat and sweet. Then we got the shrimp and scallop dish that was flaming. It was a very cool presentation. The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly not soft not rubbery. They had a perfect little snap to them. For our last appetizer we got the tuna tostada Which had amazing texture with the very thin, almost rice, puff on the bottom with the very smooth tuna on top it was wonderful. For entrées, we got the sizzling fajita platter with Carne Asada steak and blackened grilled shrimp, Perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned the Carne Asada just melted in your mouth. The shrimp had a perfect snap texture to it. All the veggies were on point still had a little tiny snap to them. The tortillas were nice and  warm. The chicken mole I’ve had it at some places where they try too hard with the chocolate to make it the star. This was such a wonderful dish. I’m actually upset that I didn’t get it for myself. Excellent amount of flavor. Cinnamon was coming through beautifully. It was perfectly cooked and it made me want to get one to go. Here is the only thing that I had a problem with really the street corn It was just OK nothing spectacular which surprised me. For desserts, we got the flaming skull flan, which was set on fire table side was very cool presentation. The chocolate was absolutely amazing and the flan was perfect texture so creamy perfectly set just melted it in your mouth. The coconut cream with berries was very similar to whipped cream, but had obviously a coconut flavor. It was amazingly well set delicious creamy and just an absolute pleasure to have. Mexican Twinkie Trio It was poundcake marshmallow with a chocolate crust. It was probably the star of the show on the desert end. It was so good we all wanted to get another order. Perfect snap on the outside absolutely soft and gooey on the inside. What more can you ask for it wasn’t dry and it wasn’t rubbery marshmallow it just checked all the boxes for all four of us.

I can easily imagine this spot packed and high energy at night.\n\nThe draft beers were a bit pricey, but that seems to be the norm in Vegas these days. The atmosphere reminded me of a classier version of Hooters, with a fun, casual energy and a polished look.

The host said seating downstairs would be immediate, but if we wanted seating upstairs, it would be about a 10-minute wait. I chose to wait for upstairs.  While we were hanging around, I did a scan of the property.\n\nThere were TVs everywhere, a beer pong setup downstairs, and a lot of activity. Very nice open layout. There was even a little corner where a live band could set up. I was hovering around the host’s podium and saw another party go up to the second floor before we were seated. I went back to the podium to check on our seating status, and she acted like she had never seen me before and looked confused. Then she informed us to go upstairs to see another host who would help us.  We went upstairs, but nobody was at the podium. A few minutes later, she came around the corner. We told her we’d like an outside table, and she led us to the balcony area with a large couch overlooking the Vegas Strip. The couch didn’t really have much shade and was getting a lot of direct sunlight. Wifey found the one shaded corner and settled in. I was fine with the direct sunlight.  Our goal was just to get something light for lunch to share. We reviewed the menu, and nothing really jumped out at us—it looked like typical bar food: pizzas, wings, the usual. We decided to share the fried mac \u0026 cheese bites and chicken tenders. We reviewed the beer selection, it had many of the usual suspects and a few local craft options. When our server came by, we started to tell her which beers we wanted, and she informed us all the kegs were down and there was no draft beer. After hearing that, we just decided to just leave and go somewhere else.  I was actually excited to try this new place, but unfortunately, it wasn’t a great first experience. The best thing I noticed was the layout, upstairs included. However, the beer and food menu, as well as the initial podium service, were not that great.  2.5 Rating"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhCoRy16kwTEvgpqtnGtkwYR\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c267ccc5e3dad9a""],""When"":""2025-10-17""},{""Name"":""Zack Murdock"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXAao5fJNIqKHeHOzdGpAph8Y61tkr2OTuTz9mxo0foKlz8Rdpb=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Predatory scam operation. Unsafe. Avoid at all costs.\n\nI bought these F1 tickets months ago, before they were even publicly listed and then quietly delisted from Bottled Blonde’s own website. I paid nearly $1,000 PER PERSON for what they advertised as premium rooftop access with views of the race — I got them as a birthday surprise for my girlfriend. Instead, what we walked into was a blatant bait-and-switch scam, run by the most hostile management team I’ve ever encountered in Las Vegas.\n\nLet me be clear:\nThere were NO views of the race. Zero.\nWhy? Because they put a giant VIP table section across the entire viewing line — meaning only VIP tables had any sightline of the track, and the rest of us were shoved behind furniture, bodies, and barriers with absolutely no visibility.\n\nAnd yet they sold these tickets as “viewing access.” This wasn’t an accident. It was deliberate and predatory.\n\nDozens of attendees around me were furious as well. Most of them had purchased through StubHub, where the seller was listed as Bottled Blonde—even though the staff later claimed they “never sold tickets through any third party.” That is a lie, and I saw it with my own eyes. The majority of guests I spoke to were holding StubHub confirmations.\n\nThey also kept changing and shifting entrance times all week long, clearly to squeeze as much money out of people as possible and keep expectations foggy right up until the moment you walked in and realized there was no view.\n\nAnd the final insult? They sold same-day GA access at the door for a fraction of what I paid, and it was literally the same thing as “premium GA” — no difference except the price. It felt like employees were improvising prices on the spot. Whether or not money was being pocketed internally, the entire operation gave off the vibe of a venue trying to milk every dollar from confused guests during F1 weekend.\n\nBut the worst part of the night was the behavior of the manager, Alex, and the management team in general. Alex was shockingly rude, dismissive, confrontational, and acted as if guests pointing out the scams were somehow the problem. When I calmly raised the obvious issues — no views, fake seat numbers, misleading ads — his response wasn’t professionalism. It was aggression. At one point he even threatened to trespass me simply for questioning why I paid nearly a thousand dollars for nothing that was promised.\n\nGiven how small and petty he acted, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s already planning his next shopping spree at Gap Kids, which is about the only place his ego and management skills belong. Corporate management should check the accounting from last night before some of that ends up spent on children’s clothes for their child manager.\n\nAnd the “free food” they advertised? Pure slop. Not premium, not curated, not remotely aligned with the price point — just low-quality cafeteria-tier food thrown together and passed off as some kind of F1 hospitality. And the so-called open bar was another scam: it didn’t even open until the race was already underway. By the time anyone could access it, the event you supposedly paid for was in full swing. It was an “open bar” in name only — deliberately delayed, clearly designed to minimize what they had to provide.\n\nThis venue is unsafe, predatory, and openly hostile to paying customers. No one should ever spend a dollar here. Frankly, the way they operated during F1 weekend, they deserve to collapse under their own financial misconduct, and Alex should never work in Las Vegas hospitality again.\n\nI’ll be joining Sarah and Michael in their complaints, filings, and every next step. This place should not be allowed to operate the way it does.\n\nAvoid this venue. Tell your friends to avoid it. If you value your safety, your money, or basic respect, do not go here."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAaBOzfCEY521B4b0ZqK3p4\u0026fid=0x0:0x7c267ccc5e3dad9a""],""When"":""2025-11-23""},{""Name"":""Jase Nisveta"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWgmVbBo-q9fbeyhazhAFjv17E-PE7EKHO36mF3AgDO3HZYYKg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Had an incredible experience at Bottle Blonde, and a huge part of that was thanks to our bartender, Calais.

She was personable without being intrusive, knowledgeable about the menu, and genuinely cared about making sure everything was perfect. The kind of bartender who reads the room effortlessly and makes you feel like a VIP without trying too hard.\n\nI ordered the Wagyu truffle burger, and it was absolutely phenomenal. Perfectly cooked, rich, juicy, and layered with deep, savory flavor. The truffle infusion was balanced and luxurious, not overpowering, and every bite tasted like a high-end steakhouse disguised as comfort food. Easily one of the best burgers I’ve had in a long time.\n\nCalais paired the food and drinks flawlessly, offering great recommendations and keeping everything flowing smoothly all night.

I am appalled by the how the managements very dismissive and unapologetic attitude in the matter, both denying that the blood was present or that it even happened when I know for a fact the coroner was here 2 days ago. They sent security to check it out whom immediately was dismissive and insisted I was wrong suggesting the pellet holes were just cigarette burns and that they wouldn't wipe away and then proceeded to use my bath towel and his foot to wipe away one of the \""cigarette burns\"" on the floor. In one swipe the dried blood outlining the pellet holes was removed and remained on the towel and the pellet holes themselves remain stained red. I didn't want to argue the point with the security guy so I went to the desk which he beat me there to warn them I was coming and then proceeded to argue the point that he's not a healthcare professional and could not say definitively wether or not it was blood that he wiped up with my towel. I said that's really inappropriate to argue semantics in the matter and you don't have to be a healthcare professional to identify blood on a floor dried and coagulated or otherwise. The desk person then begins to argue with me like my concern was for the money I paid for the room and it is definitely not, I told her it wasnt the point at all but that exposure to biohazardous materials was and that I was barefoot in there and now have to pursue means to get myself tested or checked out for exposure to that biohazard. The whole thing was extremely inappropriate and I'm both severely offended and concerned for my health and well-being. The staff was rude, ignorant, belligerent, disrespectful, dishonest and the Motel 6 company/brand should be absolutely ashamed.\n\nI'm in the process of reporting health code violations and my exposure to this biohazard and have begun seeking council in the matter because I will be litigious based solely on their poor attitudes,behavior, irresponsibility,lack of accountability, endangerment of my health and appalling \""handling\"" of a danger to peoples health that could have been avoided easily with simple communication and a desire for resolution."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhA0GEUChXT3xuShkTNiw1sb\u0026fid=0x0:0x1e4f1b26de999ef2""],""When"":""2025-12-3""},{""Name"":""J Killens"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWtEq9gGwlnF1naOQr3w9Jvt6XEvXwaGL52QPmhYz1vtkjqxVJ1=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Rooms are decent, clean and a great price.

It’s a reasonably short commute to both the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center, making it convenient without being in the middle of the congestion and noise. Getting in and out each morning was straightforward, and rideshares were easy to coordinate.\n\nThe staff were consistently friendly and helpful from check-in onward. After long days at CES, it was genuinely nice to come back to a place where the atmosphere felt calm and well run. The rooms themselves were quiet, clean, and comfortable — exactly what you want when you need good rest between early mornings and long show-floor days.\n\nThis is not a resort-style property, and it doesn’t try to be. Instead, it delivers where it matters: comfort, reliability, and a sense of ease. For the location and the price point, it felt like the right balance.\n\nIf you’re traveling to Las Vegas for work, conferences, or conventions and want something comfortable, well-located, and no-nonsense, I would recommend this DoubleTree as a dependable option."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Will"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIZgQ-F7km035BzryuQum26YfXKmSuoZP3t4RghKuxCipov=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Friendly front desk.

Beebe — Owner of GonnaHappen\nBin 702 @ Downtown Container Park – Las Vegas\n\nOn my visit to the Downtown Container Park tonight to watch football, I stopped into Bin 702, and the experience was one of the highlights of the day. The guy working there was rocking a Wu-Tang shirt — which hit home for me because of the connections I’ve had throughout my life with people from the Wu-Tang world. I’ve help them with torus in Reno and Vegas Cappadonna, Killah Priest, and the late Papa Wu (rest in peace). They were always hardworking, humble, and real — so seeing that shirt instantly brought back a piece of my story.\n\nThe staff at Bin 702 was just as impressive. They told me all about their happy hour specials, walked me through their local beers on tap, and even suggested I check out Oak \u0026 Ivy afterward. I didn’t make it this time, but the recommendation was appreciated. But on my list....\n\nI came by myself, but the entire atmosphere made me feel good. Most of the groups I saw were families or couples on dates — and honestly, it made me want to bring a date next time. But I'm single and ready to mingle and wish I new some local who wanted to hang out. The vibe is that welcoming. Even though it was a colder windy night and the park wasn’t as packed as usual, it's never super packed but flow is always steady on weekends, the energy at Bin 702 was warm, friendly, and fun.\n\nIf you’re at the Container Park and want a solid drink, great service, and a cool local vibe, Bin 702 is definitely worth the stop.\n\n#Bin702 #DowntownContainerPark #LasVegas #GonnaHappen #LocalVibes #aarongbeebe"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhA2NpcRsxKL0SALKC0n_Mqn\u0026fid=0x0:0x86e75c1a5d433394""],""When"":""2025-11-17""},{""Name"":""TravelingwithNat"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXlOlDLIRk0RZTVM8C7r_sEe0VinloLlaF28Rv1-mpzJ0RU4wkV8A=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We stopped into Bin 702 in Downtown Las Vegas planning just to grab some drinks, but the moment we walked in, we were hit with the most incredible aroma of spices and savory goodness.

Even though the kitchen was already closed, he heard how much we were raving about the smell and was kind enough to reopen it just for us.

Felt compelled to go inside the bar for information; naturally had to get a couple of drinks while there.\n\nThe current seasonal cocktail menu is \""Time Travelers\"" with each drink evoking a sense of a decade.\n\nNighthawks ($17): The 1940s, specifically the famous 1942 Hopper painting of a nighttime diner. Drink was poured into a white coffee cup, tasted of black coffee, smoke, and bitter earth. Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal as a sweet counterpoint was scattered in the saucer.\n\nSisters of Mercy ($17): Named for the 80s goth rock band, at the point in time when they performed in Detroit. Cocktail was super dry, woody, bittersweet.\n\nBoth cocktails were invented by Brian, who also happened to be my server at the bar.\n\nValue: High for strong drinks with a story.\n\nService: Very nice from both Brian and Amber.\n\netc\nTrolley was a recent purchase with an idea to have it as an eye-catching event space. Couldn't find out if the vehicle was actually mobile.\n\n23 March 2025\nStop number Four on the Arts District Alcohol Discovery Tour.\n\nAtmosphere: Victorian occult inside, casual garden party outside. Plus a DJ booth and neon, as we are still in Las Vegas.\n\nLiked the menu for its many faces of woman theme. Opted to start with The Faceless Old Woman ($16) primarily because of its name; presented a deep viperish flavor. Then ordered Catherine's Kiss ($17), a gentle sweet mind mug.\n\nValue: Tops for theme and creativity.\n\nService: Very nice."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgMDw1sXwIg\u0026fid=0x0:0xec9f75c8c384b810""],""When"":""2025-3-25""},{""Name"":""Matthew Shockley"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW7dZclCqtkQrgnEQX1S00Yaw7jOjvmrDLXHqET99cTe2lLS38I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""No Food Available, ughhgugg...

He then proceeds to add an once of alcohol, if that, to each drink....no matter how many shots you order, 1, 2, or 3 He gives u the same pour or amount. His trick is, turning his back to you after he starts pouring.\nHe gives the illusion as if he is pouring a proper pour, but he's not.\nHe is ripping people off left and right. And it's a crying shame.\nUpdate: I just spoke with taylor, assistant supervisor at the bar, he refused to give me my money back for those dispecaable drink I order. He proclaimed rudely that it was my fault that I didn't order more alcohol. He was so unprofessional and kept cutting me off as i plead my case......no matter what I said, how I said it, he refused to refund the bad product.\nI even asked him....why??? Why?? Why are you doing this, why are you being so mean and rude to me? Why, wouldn't you want to be in good standing with your customers and Google reviews?\nThat did not phase him at all. He got angry and agitated and blamed me. I was expecting exceptional customer service from such a world renowned establishment.\n\""Ma'am we are so sorry to hear you were not satisfied with our product that we served you this afternoon, I can see  where they may have been a slight misunderstanding on our part on what the drinks contains. We would be more than happy and honored to provide you with a refund this one time as a courtesy to you and to leave you with an amazing experience from our establishment. Thank you so much for your feedback.\nWe hope this correction turns you into a valued returning customer.\n\nSafe travels,\nThe D\""\n\nNope, that's not the response I received. I got a big 'Kick rocks, who cares what you didn't like' from taylor...(not his exact words but that's how he made me feel😔).\n\nMore importantly, and i shared this with taylor, all the bad reviews say the same thing about the drinks. All of them! He could have took the opportunity to make things right across the board...change some people minds and show that he really cares about the customer experience. But no, he stood on business and stood firm on not trying in the least bit to rectify the situation. Not even an apology.\nNot even, \""hey next time you're in town stop by, let's see what we can do for you.\n\nNothing but a horrible attitude of frustration.\n\nThanks taylor.\nHow much does kindness cost?"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""stacy borders"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVKBfbv_NEKOgympskAxkM22Lmn6bUFQ-Rig45eCF80U3-H3BS3=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Worst experience I’ve ever had in Vegas at a bar /casino , been coming for yrs , nice place , cool casino .

There's a $5 cover charge per person to get in, most games require money to play, and along with each drink being $15-$20 no matter what's in it, the bill WILL rack up very fast. Be prepared to spend over $50 on just drinks alone.\n\nSpecialty drinks tasted great, but they were $20 no matter what was in them. It doesn't really seem to make sense for a drink with 8 different alcohols in it to cost the same as a drink with 3. I ordered a vodka cranberry hoping for a cheaper drink, and it was $15 and HEAVILY watered down. The drinks are also given in flimsy and small plastic cups.

Bar is a hidden gem in the Las Vegas Arts District! From the moment you walk in, you’re greeted with friendly, welcoming service that makes you feel right at home. The vibe is unbeatable! Great music, creative decor, and colorful wall murals make the whole place feel alive.\n\nThe food is just as impressive as the atmosphere. Their happy hour specials are fantastic! Especially the $10 two-topping pizza, which is both delicious and a steal for the quality. The brunch options are amazing too, with generous portions and fresh flavors that make it worth coming back for. I also love that they offer regular $4 pizza slices and great drink specials all week long, making it perfect for casual get-togethers or a relaxed night out.\n\nWhether you’re stopping by for brunch, happy hour, or a late-night bite, Audio Bar delivers every time. The combination of great food, awesome ambiance, and laid-back yet lively energy makes this spot one of the best dining locations in the Arts District.

We had 14 people, which is the max the bike can hold. It was truly a blast. It's basically a pub crawl on wheels. We went to a few new bars I didn't even know existed and rode up and down the backstreets of downtown Vegas blaring music and ringing cowbells while people on the street rubbernecked at the sight. Totally unique and just plain fun. Perfect way to end our week of meetings and a terrific bonding excursion. We have rounded up some friends and already booked another round of this in a a few weeks."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",null,,1

This business is located in downtown Las Vegas. They have Trap Bingo and Karaoke on Tuesday nights. It states on their Instagram, entry was free before 10 PM. We arrived around 8:40 PM. Upon arrival outside, there is a security guard we showed ID’s to. This didn’t appear to be the rundown ghetto part of downtown Las Vegas. We felt pretty safe in this area. I’m not sure about parking, since we just took an Uber here. It did appear that they had side street parking, however I didn’t see anywhere you had to purchase it so maybe it’s free. The security guard did not check my boyfriend’s pockets or my purse before we entered. Once we entered the establishment it was quaint, clean, and had a laidback ambience. They had R\u0026B and Hip-hop hits playing overhead. We decided to sit at the bar, but there were other patrons smoking hookah and having drinks. They do have a QR code hookah menu, where you can select your hookah flavor. We don’t smoke hookah, so we didn’t partake. The bartender Sierra was very nice, professional, and welcoming. We asked her for a drink menu, but they don’t have one. I decided to order a Bahama mama and my boyfriend ordered a Mojito. The drinks didn’t take long to make. I do feel they need a drink menu! The Bahama mama was its standard flavorful drink. It was sweetly balanced and not overly strong. My boyfriend enjoyed his Mojito and I did sample it myself. The Mojito was refreshing and pretty balanced. They also have food at this establishment, but we had already eaten before arrival. They have several TV’s right by the bar. We were able to watch the WNBA playoffs game and the US Open tennis matches. I asked the bartender what time the Trap Bingo was starting and she stated it would be around 9 PM. She also stated they would have Karaoke that night more than likely. They also have a back room area, which I was able to go view. We were informed we also could sit back here in this area, but just not at the high top tables which require reservations. I just sipped on my Bahama mama throughout our time there. The bartender checked on us consistently to see if we needed anything or wanted to order anything else. Like any bar, you can start a tab and leave it open or close it upon purchasing your items. Keep in mind they do add 18% gratuity to every bill, which seems to be a standard practice for black owned businesses these days. As the night went on, several more patrons entered the building and were seated. We also noticed that they never did Trap Bingo like the bartender stated. We stayed here for about an hour and a half and they still hadn’t started. They did start broadcasting music videos on one of the TVs, which had a statement at the bottom entitled Hip-Hop Bingo. I felt this was a bit misleading on their part as a business. I even directly asked the bartender who stated they would have Bingo on this evening. It also states this as I said on their Instagram page. I feel this is a gimmick to get patrons to come in on a Tuesday night to order drinks, hookah, and food. It appeared throughout the night at times they were going to start the Trap Bingo. It never came to fruition for some reason when we were there. I don’t not recommend this place, but definitely don’t pay attention to their advertisements. Especially the advertisements of them having Trap Bingo on Tuesday nights, if you go on a Tuesday. I do feel more than likely on a Wednesday night they do have live music and a band. This is due to the business advertising it more heavily on their Instagram and website pages. Overall this was a pretty good evening and we did enjoy ourselves for the amount of time we stayed. We decided to leave around 10 PM, because they still hadn’t started the Trap Bingo. I’m still unsure if it actually took place after we left. I think it’s great that this establishment is a black owned lounge in Las Vegas. This is quite unique and rare. You don’t find a lot of black owned establishments in Las Vegas, let alone a lounge."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgICejI2Gbg\u0026fid=0x0:0x265af1225d17f576""],""When"":""2022-9-7""},{""Name"":""Patricia Hughes"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVIZQ1A8f0ecMevPGeFM1cT4cHXMWFqkFd2uLCCduzjod2d8E5bLQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The best cocktail lounge in downtown Las Vegas!

Finally someone comes out and asks what I needed again. Get my keg, tap, tub and leave.\n\nGo to install the party pump(tap) and of course it doesnt work. Leaks and produces nothing but foam.

Sorry I am not up to par with these terms.\n\nWhatever, I get my tap and leave and eventually get to enjoy my beer.\n\nThe return of the keg, tap, and tub was even worse.

Um hello how about you finish this transaction first? So I get to stand around for another 5 minutes waiting for help when Tyler comes up and says if I am not purchasing anything else I can leave out the lanes.\n\nNo mention of my deposit. Again I dont work here so I assume they willl scan the items in and I will get my deposit. Now at this point I dont trust anything from your employees so I call up as I am halfway home and not to my shock I have to return to the store.\n\nWhen I arrive to the store Tyler, who is the one who ends up doing my return and deposit didnt apologize for making me come back.

past those mid-range neighborhood shops is a necessary evil to get to this location, which is a horse of a different color and well worth the haul. The whole operation is spinning like a top, offering more wines than Erica could shake a stick at in a lifetime. Finding a proper selection of hard kombucha—the absolute favorite—is usually a mission, but seeing brands like Flying Embers and JuneShine chillin' in the cooler is a proper result.\n​Stepping into the Beer Cave is a fair sight better than your average walk-in, especially when hunting for kegs or large-scale beer options to keep a shindig going. Catching a tasting on the weekend is a real treat, proving the neighborly staff is actually in the business of people while they manage everything from the massive wall of minis to those clever Bulleit and Traeger gift baskets.

Thursday for their live band the Sonz and the drinks and vibe, they did not disappoint. The host maybe manager, two girl bartenders and the social media guy were chill And kind but homeboy with the hat needs an attitude check those drinks weren’t made with good vibes. It really makes a difference when someone loves their job and transmits that. When worker is passionate the food and drinks can be shit and somehow still can taste fire. i’ll make sure to call him out next time in person on the spot in a polite manner, I was just wanted to have a good time last night . when you talk to employee and they completely ignore you that ain’t it..Tipped 18% to guy tipped the girl 20% I think her name was Maria. She took her the time to let me sample two sours was patient and attentive. I forgot to get a picture, but the Michelada flight is a must when visiting this establishment.

From the moment we walked in, we were immediately greeted with genuine care and attention. I was with my parents, who are older and very particular, and we were originally going to another nearby spot. I convinced them to try somewhere new; and I’m so glad I did.\n\nMy mom, who is extremely picky, ordered a 25 oz michelada and absolutely loved it. She said it’s the best michelada she’s had in Vegas. That alone says a lot. Sisco was so attentive. he even had her sample different beers until we found the perfect one, “Nueva Esperanza.” That level of patience and care is rare.\n\nOn a personal note, I didn’t expect to walk in and hear Enjambre (a band I love), but that just added to the magic of the moment. We had a small bite, enjoyed the atmosphere, and truly felt taken care of.\n\nWhat really stood out, though, was Sisco himself. Customers were coming in specifically to see him, and now I understand why. I live nearby and usually go to other bars, especially in the Arts District…but I’ll be coming back here just because of Sisco. You can get drinks anywhere, but you can’t get him everywhere.\n\nHe listens, he makes thoughtful recommendations, he genuinely cares, and he asks why you chose to be there. He’s a true gem 💎 Please take care of him - he made this Saturday morning special not just for my parents and me, but for everyone who walked in that day.\n\nThank you for allowing me to express my gratitude for Sisco. 🙏"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""ruben salas jr"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU9sgTG1Xs3WBhPyvNSGETr_K2b9ChbMYeWtaEGMfjwck7Y619D=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best brewery in town and the food trucks outside are delicious 😋 great place and the bartenders are kind and helpful 😀"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhATy07ffGAatCT8wWoRgTrl\u0026fid=0x0:0xa7b2ab1b9882e90d""],""When"":""2025-11-5""},{""Name"":""Jeff"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXq55SeVa9NOEAPNNkud1seoWPAYnroPQkYxnEBEX07YDKNV1w54Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Beer flights with some unique sour flavors.
